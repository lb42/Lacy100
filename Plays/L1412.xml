     gals have got sich high notions, it’s disgustin’. ’Cos Simon is common, they’ve re-christened

    <p>Very. You see, they met him at their Aunt <pb n="4"/> Barkins’s house, when they were
     stopping there. He showed all those little delicate attentions which we women understands and
     appreciates. Miss Jane and Miss Sarah have done nothing but quarrel ever since the letter came.
