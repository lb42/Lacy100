<p>Because if you were, you would know that on the vast continent of America, on
the other side of the Atlantic—in Australia, on the other side of the Pacific—in
Her Majesty's possessions in India—at the Cape of Good Hope—and in some of the
Friendly and Marquesas Islands—even at remote New Zealand, they speak the
English language.</p>

<p>No more there isn't; but all it wants is a carpet and some chairs, and a

<p>Giving sixpence for threepenn'orth of snuff is certainly paying through the
nose. Well, here I am shut up in prison, like a dumb or incarcerated negro—a
shut up Black. Me, in gaol!—me, a respectable tradesman! without a spot upon his
reputation, and without snuff? Unlucky, was the hour, now a fortnight ago, when
I took a chemist's and druggist's business. Having purchased the business, I
naturally concluded that I was a chemist and druggist—so I set to work and
compounded various medicines, among others an Eye-water. A patient came into my
shop who was afflicted with opthalmia— <pb n="5"/>I recommended my Eye-water. He
bought it, he applied it, and in three days he was completely cured of one eye
altogether. The opthalmia had disappeared, and taken one of his eyes with it. He
came to me, said my Eye-water was all my eye and Betty Martin. I told him that I
had miscalculated, that I was out— and he interrupted me by saying that his eye
was out. I repeated that I too was out—he insisted that his one eye was out too.
I was immediately accused of practising medicine without being duly
qualified—and here I am, remanded!—but why should I complain ? Galileo was not
understood by his age. What will my wife think of my prolonged absence ? She's
as jealous as— a woman ; now I feel every confidence in her, and therefore have
placed a watch upon her every movement. Oh, if I only had my snuff box, it might
inspire me with the thought of how to get out of this! I've read Monte Christo
and Jack Sheppard —he got out of Newgate with no help but his own fingers and
one nail. <stage>(feeling his pockets.)</stage> Have I a nail? No, nothing but a
toothpick. <stage>(noise of locks, &amp;c., outside.)</stage> Some one coming
—let me conceal my crowbar.</p>

<p>Whew ! thank Heaven he's gone ! The idea of my pretending to be a
thief!—Lothario White! a respectable teacher of languages! who never in his life
took anything—stop ! when I say I never took anything, I'm wrong, for this
morning I took an omnibus—or I should say the omnibus took me—for I received a
letter from a lady in this neighbourhood, saying she wanted to learn Italian. I
had scarcely taken the omnibus for five minutes—or more correctly speaking, the
omnibus had scarcely taken me five minutes, before I heard a sweet, melodious
voice, that sounded like "the murmurs of lone fountains, that gush forth in the
midst of roses," exclaim, "I haven't got my tuppence." I turned round—I looked
at her—'twas Julia—my Julia, who hadn't got her tuppence. The conductor gave it
her—my emotion was easier to be imagined than described—to meet with Julia, to
whom I was once going to be married—but her stupid old father married her to
somebody else—I say again to meet with Julia—to find her—my first love married,
in an omnibus, and wanting her tuppence. She told me that she lived in the
neighbourhood. She got out of the vehicle—so did I—she led me <pb n="8"/> to her
house—we entered together—we closed the door— and for the second time that
morning, I took a 'bus ; at that interesting and auspicious moment, whose bliss
was of linked sweetness long drawn out! the door opened—a man appeared (Julia
whispered me he was her husband's friend), he cried "Policeman, I have found
that man in the house under suspicious circumstances—I give him in charge.
Policeman advanced, seized me by the collar—and here I am in prison— but by the
heavens above us I am as innocent <stage>(kneels melodramatically.)</stage>—of
all but having taken an omnibus—without any felonious intent. Little did I think
that omnibus would drive me to despair.</p>
