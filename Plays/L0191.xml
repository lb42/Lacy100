    <head>Act I.</head>
    <stage type="setting">Scene—An apartment in the house of Madame de Fontanges. The room is
     spacious and handsomely furnished in the semi-classical style of the empire, with large folding
     doors communicating (in flat) with an adjoining room. A secret door in the wall (R.) concealed
     by a picture, and another side-door communicating with the staircase. Windows practicable. (L.)
     A writing table with writing materials. (L. C.) Caraffe of water and glasses. Fauteuils
     disposed about the stage. Fire-place between the windows, with bronze pendule and candelabra,
     and a glass over it.</stage>
    <stage>Cecile at the fire-place. Jabot arranging the inkstand and a breviary on the
     table.</stage>

     <speaker>Jabot.</speaker>
     <p>Cecile, how often must I repeat to you that servants in a good family ought never to be
      astonished? Madame is young, charming, a widow, and may choose her own hours.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0191_F9">
     <speaker>Cecile.</speaker>
     <p>For her visitors—yes; but you forget this is her night for receiving her Confessor; she

     <speaker>Jab.</speaker>
     <p>Pooh! she must leave a few of her sins to stand over till next week—there's a running

     <p>  Thank you, my children—I wish to be alone— see that no one enters this room, except your
      mistress, or my other penitent, M. de Cevennes, should he arrive.<stage>Jabot bows, Cecile
      curtsies, and exeunt, L. Fouché, rising, takes a rapid survey of the room, then closes the
      window curtains, places the lights on the mantelpiece, and bolts the door by which they have
      gone, and also the folding-doors.</stage></p>

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Never trust an order while there's a bolt. Now for my ferret:—to all but me, M. le Bon, the
      respectable proprietor of the house next door—to me, Maximilian Desmarets, the most
      unmitigated rascal and most invaluable head of a secret department in Europe. It was a good
      idea of mine to establish him next door to Madame de Fontanges. We meet here unobserved.

      door)</stage> Hist! Desmarets!<stage>Enter from the secret door Desmarets, with a despatch-box

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>You would serve me no better, and she would not serve me at all; besides, she has the

    <sp who="#L0191_M2">
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>She!—so much for the world's judgment of a confirmed gambler!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0191_M1">
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>That is her only vice—a secret confined to us,   and her mask! It was a good thought to
      allow of masks at the public tables.</p>

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>They save many reputations. No, my excellent Desmarets, I have not spent twenty years in
      guaging the price of consciences without arriving at a tolerably fair estimate of the money
      value of my species, from Kings downwards.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0191_M2">

     <p>I know your <hi>head</hi> is, and, as times go, that is perhaps a better security. But to

     <p>Two.—<stage>(takes papers)</stage> One from Mons. Ouvrard, announcing that he has opened a
      negotiation for peace in <hi>your</hi> name, with the Foreign Secretary, but that he fears
      your other agent, Mons. Fagan, is not to be trusted.</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0191_M2">
     <speaker>Des.</speaker>
     <p>  From M. Fagan, stating that your overtures for peace have been most favourably received by
      the English Prime Minister, but that he has reason to believe M. Ouvrard is in the pay of the
      Emperor.</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="6"/>
    <sp who="#L0191_M1">
     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Ordered—that M. Fagan establish a close espionage on M. Ouvrard. <stage>(Desmaret's makes a
      note on despatch as before)</stage> I have long found the advantage of running my agents in

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Good; by that time I shall have concluded my negociations, and the Emperor will have found

      cannot do without us.</p>

     <speaker>Fou.</speaker>
     <p>Hem! he has trusted me too far, Desmarets. Those letters, from his own hand, extending over
      the last ten years, are my security. While I have those, I stake his credit against my

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>So: you may go, Cecile. <stage>(Gives hat to Cecile: who puts it on couch, and exit,
      L.)</stage> He has been playing truant for the last twenty-four hours, and this explains his
      absence, I suppose. Poor fellow! I fear my dart has pierced rather deeper into that bare bosom
      <pb n="25"/> than into the well-padded chests of my Parisian adorers.   The vehemence of his
      passion startles me sometimes. It is his tropical temperament, I suppose. The sun, which has
      bronzed his cheek, may have enriched his blood and quickened his susceptibilities, but can it
      make nature truer, or affection more constant? No! he may be as changing
       and hollow as the rest. If you could but believe in
      man, what a glorious thing love would be! The few tranquil weeks I have spent here, since by a
      simple artifice I made his acquaintance, I really think have been the four happiest of my
      life. I have not once missed the excitement of the cards! Strange! in playing with his heart,
      there have been moments when his earnestness has shot a sudden thrill through me which I never
      felt before. If it were the first stir of love! Pshaw! let me remember what I am, and what I
      have to do! I wish Fouché had found another instrument. But his note. <stage>(she opens it and
      reads)</stage> “Madame—” Madame! we are distant this morning, Monsieur—“If I listened to the
      promptings of my heart I would not begin thus coldly—” listen to them, Monsieur! happy you if
      you hear anything— “but I dare not, and yet I cannot stifle them. I love you madly—” poor
      fellow! “with a passion violent like my nature, but reverential as my worship of that saint
      whose sweet name you bear—” pretty! “my love is so real, so ungovernable—you must have seen
      it—” What were eyes given us for? “and yet you will not deal with me as a true-hearted   woman
      should.” Alas! if truth and heart both be wanting! “I would live for you—die for you—and you
      but trifle with me. Either tell me I am indifferent to you, and then I will go and wrestle
      with my grief alone, or show, by a tenderness like my own, that you are worthy of as true a
      devotion as ever man felt for woman.” <stage>(she pauses)</stage> “I have struggled with
      myself the whole night through before writing this—I am almost mad. If I am too bold, forgive
      me—for I cannot live out of your sight: may I come for your answer.—Henri de Neuville.”
      <stage>(she sits and lets the letter fall on her lap)</stage> If it should be true that his
      heart is of a different mould from those that till now have found their best use as my
      playthings, what a terrible task is this I am about? I will go no further with it! But
      Fouché's orders are irrevocable; and, alone as I am here, so far away from Paris, I feel as if
      his cold relentless eye was on me at every turn.
      <pb n="26"/> Who knows? this man may after all be only a more consummate actor than the rest!
      This show of rough sincerity may be art. No, no! I feel in my inmost self that he is true and
      noble! To win such a heart might make any woman proud; but to win it on a cold, passionless

     <p>You thought the hot wind of play had dried up in me all that was good or akin to good.—I
      thought so too.—Neither of us knew how vital the roots of love are in
      <pb n="42"/> a woman's nature. At contact with the fresh and springing life of his passion my
      dead affection wakened, till what we both thought a stone became a living, leaping, loving,

     <p>I resolved to risk my life to save his. I knew all I exposed myself to in disobeying your

     <speaker>Mad. de Fon.</speaker>
     <p>I meant, after telling you the truth, to have appealed to the good I cannot believe utterly
      dead in you, now that it has revived in me. Ah, Fouché! think of all that virtuous love means
      in a woman like me—self-scorning, self-loathing, living only to be the prey of frantic
      excitement, or the tool of dark intrigues.—It is the branch that sweetens the bitter waters of
      my life—the ray that breaks upon the labours of the prisoner to tell him he has pierced the
      outer wall of his dungeon. Till I knew it, I had nothing to believe in—nothing to
      venerate—nothing to live for. Having it, a future of peace and purity opens before me. Do not
      darken this future! Spare him, that I may love him—far from Paris, far from plots, and
      intrigues, and passions. Spare him, Fouché! spare him! —and spare me! <stage>(she has risen
