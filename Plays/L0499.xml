        <stage>A Parlour in Cozy Cottage, Brompton, (2nd grooves) tastefully furnished; door of
          entrance, R. 1 E.; door of Todd’s room, L.1 E.; window, with curtains drawn, C. flat.—A
          large leather travelling case on chair, R. C.; carpet bag, hat case, bandboxes, and a pair
          of boots on the floor; fishing rod, telescope, and umbrellas scattered about the room,
          which exhibits the disorder indicative of preparation for a journey.  A table, C., on
          which is a writing desk, two candles lighted, a chamber candlestick unlighted, and work
          basket.  An arm chair, L., with concertina and case on it;—chairs R. and L. of
          table.</stage>

            cap and your Indian shawl?</p>

        <sp who="#L0499_F3">
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> Perks, I’m astonished at your suggesting such an association:—put them in the carpet

          <p>Perks.  La, mum, there’s not room for a tooth-pick in the carpet bag; how we’re ever to
            get it’s jaws closed again I don’t know; and there’s a dressing case, and a box of
            cigars, and a fishing rod, and two umbrellas, a telescope and a pair of slippers, to be
            put up yet!</p>

          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p><stage>(L.)</stage>  No, my dear, our route.  I’ve been studying Bradshaw all the
            morning, and I find that if we leave—page 49—I mean, if we leave the Paddington—no—the
            Euston-square Station—at 7 o’clock, a.m., we can get by the Oxford Junction
              to—to—page—<stage>(turning over the leaves)</stage> page—page—no—that’s the Tilbury
            and Southend Line.  Ah! here it is!—we’re then to take the express train to—to
            York—where we meet the Midland Counties, you perceive, and then see—page
              74—<stage>(turning over the leaves)</stage> 74—74—74—74—where there’s a branch to the
            Eastern Counties that takes us to Norwich—and when we get to Norwich there’s a junction
            that takes us—somewhere—I don’t precisely know where—but I have a strong reliance on
            Bradshaw.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#L0499_F3">
          <speaker>Mrs. T.</speaker>
          <p> I wish you would put down Bradshaw, Todd, and exert the limited powers with which
            heaven has blessed you, and help me to pack and cord these things—you leave everything
            for me to do.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#L0499_M1">
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> My dear Laura, there’s the difference between us—you’re remarkable for physical
            energy—I for contemplative repose.  The study of Bradshaw fatigues one’s mind so.
              <stage>(Perks, who has been clearing off luggage, R., gets round at back to L. and
              takes up concertina from chair)</stage>  Mind that concertina, Perks—it’s the only
            instrument I play—<stage>(takes it from her, C.)</stage>, and having devoted myself for
            six months to “My Mary Ann,” I rather flatter myself I shall create an extraordinary
            sensation amongst the foreign echoes this summer. <stage>(he commences playing “My Mary
              Ann,” when a knock is heard)</stage>  Hah! who can this be?</p>
        </sp>

        <sp who="#L0499_M1">
          <speaker>Todd.</speaker>
          <p> Your uncle, my dear, is a very worthy man.  I should feel bound to respect his
            venerable hairs, if he had any left to respect, but that hydropathic habit he has—of
            throwing cold water upon everything—is very disagreeable.</p>

          <p> Aye, what do you think of six months amidst the classic scenes of Italy.  Fancy
            smoking a cigar on the summit of Vesuvius; think of dancing the Tarantula amidst the
            ruins of Pompeii; imagine the delicious maccaroni—and the lazzaroni—and all the other
            oni’s. <stage>(forgetting himself)</stage>  Picture to yourself the indescribable

              <stage>(crosses back to L.)</stage>  By the bye, Croker, is there anything we can do

          <p>Croker’s suggestion about arranging my worldly affairs should not be neglected.
              <stage>(sits at L. of table and takes papers out of writing-desk)</stage>  I have some
            papers and documents here which I must put in order before I depart for “that
            undiscovered bourne from whence no traveller gets a return ticket.”  Pshaw!  I must not
            let the dismal forebodings of old Croker prey upon me!  Now! think of it, I’ll light one
            of those Turkish cigarettes, which my friend, Captain Crasher, brought home from the
            East.  He tells me they’re prepared with opium and produce the most tranquillizing
            effect on the spirits. <stage>(he takes a cigar case from the table drawer and lights a
              cigarette)</stage>  This I hope will restore the serenity of my mind.  Be a man, Todd!
            be a man!  Croker’s an ass!  He and his stories may go to the devil. <stage>(smoking and
              arranging his papers)</stage>  Humph! ha! pooh! capital weed! <stage>(taking up a
              bundle of papers)</stage>  What are these?  “Accounts settled.”  Um! um! <stage>(puts
              them down and takes up another parcel, turning them over)</stage>  Mrs. Todd’s letters
            to me when we were courting.  Ah! delicious smoke!  A lock of her silken hair!
              <stage>(smoking)</stage>  How beautifully it curls! and this brown sprig of myrtle,
            which she wore the night we vowed to love for ever.  Ha! we were green then!  Her eyes
            remind me of—<stage>(reading endorsement on another document)</stage>  “The last will
            and testament of Samuel Todd.”  Dear me! what a sudden chill the sight of this solemn
            instrument brings over me.  The paper looks so ghastly white, and the ink so deadly
            black; that, gazing at it as I sit here, seems like staring in the face of my own
            ghost.  Pshaw!  I’ll not give way to these desponding fancies! <stage>(smoking)</stage> 
            By the bye, I may as well add a codicil to my will.  I’ve been thinking about it for
            some time; no one can tell what may happen.  Let me see—<stage>(running over the
              will)</stage> “I give and bequeath <pb n="9"/>all that and those”—um, um, um, um, um,
            um—“three per cent. consols”—um, um, um—“Shares in the”—um, um, um—“bank stock, goods,
            and chattels, to my beloved wife, Laura,”—um, um, um!  Now for the codicil,
              <stage>(writes)</stage> “Provided always, that if my said wife shall survive me, and
            shall intermarry with a second husband, I hereby revoke all and every of the bequests
            hereinbefore contained.”  That’s only justice!  If it was my misfortune to be left a gay
            widower—would I marry again? never!  At least, not until I had reflected
            seriously—and—pooh!  Deliciously soothing this cigarette!—not until, I had weighed in my
            mind,—the—delightful aroma, and the—object however lovely, with—the memory of the dear
            departed,—and the natural—weakness of—of—my head—no—my heart—and conjugal affection.—I’m

            have a sail on the bay, though he knew the sea always upset me—and it <emph>did</emph>
            upset me—it upset us all—for our boat was overturned by a squall, and I should
            inevitably have died an amphibious death, if I had not clung instinctively to life;—and
            a vigorous sailor, who swam—and swam—and swam, until we were fortunately picked up by
