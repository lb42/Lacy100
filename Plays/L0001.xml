    <stage type="setting">Scene.— Handsome, Apartment in the House of Leeson and Bates, Merchants —
     Door in C , with window on each side — Doors L.C. Flat and R. 2 E., Chairs, Tables, Sofa,
     &amp;c., &amp;c. </stage>
    <stage>Mr. Leeson seated at table, R.H., over his private accounts. He puts his pen in inkstand,
     and closes book.</stage>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>That account's closed—a clear net profit to our house, Leeson and Bates, of nine thousand
      pounds for the last year. So that, notwithstanding my little extravagance for music and other
      masters for my daughter, I am at least a two thousand pounds better than I was twelve months
      since. 'Gad! this is capital—this is well! <stage>(rises)</stage> I don't know a prouder,
      happier feeling that can enter the heart of man, than the knowledge that he leaves the being
      of his very soul— his only child, the image of her he worshipped in his spring of life— free
      from the chance of chilling poverty. It makes my heart leap for joy when I think of it. Ha!
      here she comes.</p>
     <stage> Enter Laura, D.R. 2 E. </stage>
     <p>— Laura, my own pet, come to my arms! Oh! bless that face! how it reminds me of your dear
      mother, now in— But there, we won't be melancholy to-day.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_F7">
     <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! for mercy's sake, no, dear Sir; this house is not too lively at the best of times.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Well, well—we'll be merry to-day, of all days in the year. But, where's your cousin ?
      Where's my partner, Mathew Bates ?— what have you done with him ?—where is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_F7">
     <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
     <p>Now, my dear Sir, how should I know where he is? I never appear before you, but your first
      question is—" Where is Mathew ?—what have you done with Mathew Bates?" Is Mathew Bates to be
      ever at my side ? He loves his desk better than he loves society, I can tell you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Well, I know he's fond of business; so am I—I always was.<stage>( playfully)</stage> If I
      had not been fond of business, you little rogue, I should not have had the pleasure of telling
      you, as I do now—that I have ten thousand pounds for you when you wed, and as much more at my
      death.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_F7">
     <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
     <p>Which, my dear father, I trust may not occur for many— many years.</p>

     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>I hope not, upon my soul. I am very well as I am, and I don't want to change my
      condition.</p>
     <stage> Enter Mathew Bates, L.U.E. ; he is very plainly attired, having the appearance of a
      young man without the fashionable pretension of dress, and his style altogether unpretending —
      he has a pen in his hand. </stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M2">
     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Leeson, good day. Cousin— <stage>(to Laura, with respect)</stage></p>

     <p>Yes, and will be more by-and-bye—eh, Mathew ? <stage>(jokingly, but with

    <sp who="#L0001_M2">
     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(L.H.)</stage>Your son, Mr. Leeson, I truly am; for my father and yourself were
      cousins, and, at his death, you became my protector. You were relatives in heart as well as
      kin—friends—fast friends; which, in kin, is often cast aside.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>True, true, Mathew ! Ah, we were mere boys together, poor boys too, with nothing but our
      energy to raise us. But we were friends, as you say—fast friends, and we were so to his death.
      Poor Harry! We were odd fellows— <stage>(to Laura, who comes down R.)</stage>—we were,
      Laura.</p>

    <sp who="#L0001_F7">
     <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(L.C.)</stage>I don't doubt, Sir, at all. You are odd to this day, and so is Harry's
       son.<stage>( glancing at Mathew)</stage></p>

     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p>In what particular, Laura ?</p>

     <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, if you ask for <hi>particularities,</hi> we shall come to <hi>personalities,</hi> and
      then I shall be scolded—shall I not, pa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Aye, that you will. But, come, I find that we are both richer men;—a net profit this year
      of nine thousand pounds to our house.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M2">
     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, Sir, to that amount.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Egad, when I think how I toiled to get my first start in the world ! So did your father !
      Oh, yes! for there were two girls, poor as ourselves; we loved <hi>them,</hi> and
       <hi>they</hi> loved us. Tis something to be loved in this cold world, I can tell you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M2">
     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p>It is, indeed, Sir!<stage>( with a sigh, glancing at Laura.)</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Well, we struggled and we succeeded, prospered, and, in prosperity, we both married the
      girls who had loved us in adversity. Heaven, after, gave him a son and me a daughter, but took
      our partners from us; his first—mine after. Her loss weighed heavy upon his heart, and he
      shortly followed.—Poor Harry ! I shall never forget his dying hour! "John," said he, "be a
      father to my little Mathew!" "I will—I will, Harry," said I, grasping his cold hand, while
      tears flooded my eye, and grief choked my utterance. "And if the children like each other,"
      placing my hands on your little heads, as you stood almost unconscious of the scene before
      you, " <hi>your</hi> Mathew shall marry <hi>my</hi> Laura, and be indeed my son!" He raised
      his eyes to heaven, in reverence, then looked his last kind look upon us, and left us for a
      better inheritance!</p>

      you will ever touch upon this subject.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0001_M1">
     <speaker>Lee.</speaker>
     <p>Because I can't forget it. Never shall! But come, Mathew, give me your hand—I will not
      mention it any more. Come, Laura, cheer him up; talk to him, while I go and talk to the
      clerks. I shall be back shortly, and we'll have a merry day of it. We have no reason to be
      other; we are prosperous, and there's no reason on earth that we should be miserable; for
      myself, I'm determined to be merry— nothing shall make me otherwise.<stage>Exit

     <p>Yes, indeed! by education taught to be so,—schooled in restraint, her thoughts, her
      feelings even as a girl, are pent up from the world: her own heart is the sanctum in after
      life, even of that love she pines to own, another may be dying but to know; but when known, he
      loves her more for the suffering she has caused—for he feels that she is master of herself—the
      greatest mastery achieved on earth.</p>

     <p>Woman, however she conceal her power, is ever so; for by submission, and by complacent

      and seated at his desk. I know my father, and he too, expect me to become his wife, and that I
      shall love him; as if love were entered and booked per order. Not with me, I can tell them !
      What is love without romance, danger, and difficulty—without prayers, tears, and entreaties ?
      That's the love for me; a lover my father scorns and I adore, who has not a penny in his
      purse—that's the man for me. But to marry cousin Mathew Bates ! Make love by rule of three;
      father, daughter, lover; have the settlement drawn out like a bill of exchange; marry; and
      ever after settle down into quiet Mrs. Bates. What a name !—Bates !—Mrs. Bates! Were it
      Danvers, Craven, Courtland—but Bates ! It might as well be Daw or Caw, Cook or Rook, or
      anything. No, no ! My cousin certainly has good eyes— if he knew how to use them; fine
      teeth—if he knew how to show them; and his hair is good—but the style—oh, horrid !</p>

      quit all or die. It has grown with me from childhood; to watch her varying temper was to me a

      against his brother—the post—uncertain which way the wind may carry him. He has no guiding
      principle—as they say—or impulsive power. He wants to find out which way will lead him to his
      point, forgetting all
      <pb n="11" facs="../Pages/L0001/L0001-011.jpg"/> the while that he has no point. He starts off: the hours
      move heavily—so does he—till he finds himself out of town and out of sorts;—enters a
      tavern—dines—drinks—smokes his cigar—looks out of the window—sees happy faces, lads and
      lasses, fond couples and rosy children, pass by,—sighs—puffs—gets the fidgets—starts forth
      —returns towards home,—meets another lordly freeman, as blessed as himself—they join—they

     <p>Three years since, Mathew left us, to superintend our foreign house at Lyons. Three years!
      I thought myself then free— free as the bird that skims the air in its wild and happy
      flight—free to fix my choice if the object came without restraint or control; and suitors have
      come—have offered for my hand, yet all have I rejected —and why ? Because my beau ideal of a
      lover was but a dream ! I looked for outward grace, and not for inward worth, that solid base
      on which our choice should fix. Charles Clinton ! a fashion's fool. Strange! since cousin
      Mathew left us, without to me even an adieu, he has been ever with me; as each week, month,
      year, has passed, he has come nearer to my fancy's image. Time has told its tale upon my
      heart, thoughts, and feelings; and I who drove him hence, would give the world to draw him
      back to me—but pride says no. In my dreams he is with me, in my waking hours ever in my mind.
      Remembrance of the pain I caused him strikes the chords of self-reproach, till I am unfit for
      converse or society.</p>

      father was right. I shall see him leave me in the world alone—lone in heart. And for whom? My
      cousin Mathew—for I cannot deny it to myself—I love him: I scarce dared look upon him, while
      his manly eye was fixed and firm. Oh ! how I longed for the love glances which, even in his
      boyhood, he lavished on me. I could have borne all, but the confession that he was
      another's—that I was nothing to him—his sister—oh, yes, <hi>sister!</hi> —fine term,
      truly!—and I must see him marry—present his bride to me. Never, never!</p>

     <p>Not so. My first remembrance is here. Your father, my protector; you, my playmate; and, as
      time shadowed forth all coming hope, you were the ministers, through whom I was to receive
      fortune, content, and love; and when, as in a dream,(time flew so happily on)I stepped from
      boy to man, the same feelings strengthened; day by day, I saw you pass from girl to woman's
      stature, loveliness—<stage>(she starts)</stage>Your pardon; for I flatter not. I saw no speck
      upon its radiance. I loved you—Your pardon still,<stage>(with great feeling)</stage>if the
      tear start to my eye, and recollection choke my utterance. I perceived a growing check to my
      every kind attention. Oh, the watchful, waking hours that hung upon my pillow! I strove to
      please, but, as each kind word fell tremulously from my quivering lip, it was met by raillery
      and contempt from yours. At last came the day I was to hear from the being I had worshipped,
      that, if I had nurtured in my heart one hope that she could ever be mine, I was to cast that
      feeling from me.</p>

     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, what entreaty could equal the devotion, that from boy to man I lavished upon you,
      Laura? I could not entreat; your words iced my heart, freezing my every vein; I could not ask
      that I knew must be refused. I loved you too well, with too much honour, to beg your hand, not
      coupled with your heart. Your happiness, not your misery, was my aim; and, rather than inflict
      one pang on you or yours, I fled a home, which else to me was heaven,<stage>(with great
