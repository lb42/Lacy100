<performance>
<p>First produced at the Royal Olympic Theatre, Monday,July 4th, 1853.</p>
<p>The Scenery, new and old, has been brushed up by Mr. Shalders, assisted by
Mr. W. Shalders, under the direction of Mr. William Shalders. The Characters
will find themselves smart under a sound dressing from Mr. Allen and Mrs.
Rawlings. The Mechanical Effects, at which we usually find Matthews at home,
will on the present occasion be much more easily imagined than described. It is
expected the Appointments, made under the liberal ministry of Mr. Lightfoot,
will give general satisfaction. The Music will be well treated by Mr. Barnard,
although he intends to handle it with his usual but by no means ordinary
<hi>violins.</hi>

<l>Good Mister Antonio, often when on</l>

<l>You've called me "Old Fagin" usurious dog,"</l>

<l>Some few misters cant abide to laugh </l>
<l>At what's good and Shakspearian, </l>

<l>As those who work most best can play, </l>
<l>So I'd invite them to reflect </l>
<l>That after all there may be </l>
