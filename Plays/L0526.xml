       Stay! suppose I just write, and ask for twenty-four hours' delay?—No I won't —anything is
       better than suspense. Why not send a bold refusal at once? I'm not to be bullied into
       marrying!— as to her threats about law, I have plenty of money to pay if that's all, and as
       to wives, there are plenty of them to be had; such a nice dear girl as Charlotte Manifest
       perhaps—if I dared think of her—with a hundred attractions, and no mother-in-law—no
       mother-in-law! I won't hesitate another instant. <stage>(sits down to write)</stage> “Madam—
         the peremptory nature of your letter leaves no time for consideration. I have every respect
       for Miss Pointer, and I hope and believe that I feel as I ought about you,”—she may make what
       she likes out of that—“but there is also a respect due to myself, and thus driven into a
       corner, I feel it my duty, with all becoming expression of regret, to write the painful
       monosyllable ‘No.’—Your obedient servant, Jacob Omnium.” <stage>(folds and addresses the
        note)</stage> “To Mrs. Pointer.” There, that's settled, once and for ever—there's no
       retracting now, and I shall force my friend Herbert to admit that I have such a thing as
       <pb n="23"/> firmness. <stage>(rises)</stage> I don't feel quite sure that I have done right,
       now; it is terrible to be hurried so—what shall I do? Ah! I have it, chance shall
       decide—chance has been my friend all my life, and it often decides better for us than we can
       for ourselves. Marriage is said to be a lottery, and a lottery I'll make of it,—I'll write
       another letter to say “yes,” and draw lots for which I shall send. <stage>(returns to table

      <p>  I know, kind as you are, still you are not free from the miserable vanity of human
       nature; on the point of marriage with one girl, you fancy another cares about you, and you
       cannot rest until your morbid wish to know the truth be satisfied.</p>

      <p>It shall be satisfied—it cannot signify—my sister and I shall soon be gone, and of course,
        <hi>we</hi> shall never meet again. You were kind to her when a child, and always called her
       your little wife; she contracted a childish affection for you, and grew up in the cherished
       notion that you were to be her husband, (you may not have met with such instances in life but
       I have). This notion, the difference of your ages and other personal matters, on which you
       have more lightly touched, have not had power to shake, I hope your vanity is satisfied.</p>
