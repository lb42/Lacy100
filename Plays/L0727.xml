<p>17th August,</p>
<p> Brompton, December 26, 1860.</p>
<p> My dear Blanchard, </p>
<p>It seems but a poor compliment to dedicate such an unconnected string of
doggrel as this to anybody; but, nevertheless, I do dedicate it to you, in
memory of the first Pantomime I ever saw (two and twenty years ago, and, need I
add, one of yours); and in token of my sincere admiration for your
unapproachable talent as a concocter of wholesome Christmas fun.</p>
<p>Ever yours most sincerely</p>
<p>Henry j. Byron.</p>

<stage>(Music.—Crusoe goes up and off by the ladder, over the palisade ; Friday
goes to the flour barrel <pb n="18"/> and fetches out some dough, which he
places on the table; then he brings on a large pie-dish, which he places, C.,
seizes a jar labelled "Butter," and, taking some out, butters the inside of the
pie-dish, sucking his fingers after so doing, and greasing his woolly head ; he
takes then a large knife, and, after feeling the edge, cuts slices of ham from
one hanging, L. ; these he places in the pie-dish, then peppers violently,
sneezing occasionally into the pie; when his back is turned, the Parrot enters
and snatches a slice of ham, and runs, R.; the Goat enters and attempts to take
it from the Parrot ; Friday, discovering the theft, strikes the Goat, who butts
at him and sends him backwards, in a sitting posture, into the pie-dish ; the
Dog enters, seizes the meat from the Parrot, and runs to a corner with it;
Friday gets out of the dish, a piece of ham adhering to his back — this he picks
off and returns, carefully scraping the grease off his clothes and putting it
back into the dish ; he then runs and lifts up the lid of the flour barrel,
putting his head and shoulders into it; the Parrot gives him a peck at the calf,
and the Goat tilts down the lid on his head; he wriggles about in extreme
discomfort, until he succeeds in getting himself out together with some dough
for paste, which he places on the table ; he then seizes the rolling pin, flouts
it, beats out and rolls the paste, then places the pin on the table; the Dog
seizes it and runs away —Friday after him ; he succeeds in regaining it, and
strikes the Dog, who yelps ; Friday returns to the work of the pie, and drops
some of the dough on the floor; he picks it up and picks out carefully several
foreign substances, amongst them an enormous hair, which takes him some time to
extract ; he then covers the dish with the paste, and gazes fondly on the pie
with conscious pride of an artist; the Parrot digs his long beak into the middle
of the pie and rushes away with a large piece of the paste; Friday tears his
wool in agony of rage; he <pb n="19"/>catches the Parrot and seizes the paste,
pulling violently ; the Parrot open his beak, and Friday tumbles back ; he then
rushes to the pie, claps the piece of paste over the hole, and beats it down
with the rolling pin; just at this moment an Indian howl is heard, just outside
the palisade; Friday's knees drop together, he drops the rolling pin into the
pie, and shivers violently; the Parrot, Dog, and Goat tremble terribly and
exhibit awful alarm, they sneak off, trembling ; Friday turns and observes three
long feathers swaying backwards and forwards at the top of the palisade; Friday,
in a state of abject terror, hides himself under the table; the three Indians
climb over the palisade — Hokee-Pokee, Wanky-Fum, and their King,
Hoopdeedoodendoo, a very fat monarch, completely covered with ornaments;
Hokee-Pokee and Wanky-Fum drop down on to stage, but the King sticks on the
palisade, unable to move)</stage>

alarmed)</stage>

with it after the fashion of table turners ; it becomes more rapid, and they
tumble ;Friday throws the table flat on to them, and escapes into the flour
barrel; comic business on the part of the King , who looks up and gradually
rises, kicking his brother Indians ; they become jovial, when they see the lid
of the flour barrel moving, and they all tremble and sneak towards the palisade;
suddenly Friday pops his head (covered with the table cloth which he has taken
with him into the barrel) out of the barrel; the Indians give a simultaneous
howl, and jump at the top of the palisade, they hang on; the Goat rushes on, and
butts at the hanging form of the King ; the Dog seizes Hokee - Pokee, and the
Parrot digs his beak into Wanky-Fum's back, and hangs suspended from him; Friday
howls, and rattles the flour barrel lid with violent gesticulations; the Indians
swing, roaring as the scene closes)</stage>

<stage> During the revel, Friday , habited in a semi-Indian costume, enters,
joins the dance, goes through some extraordinary antics, and at last succeeds in
arresting Jenny Pigtail's attention ; he gives her a bottle, and expresses by
action that she is to give it to the Indians , and that drowsiness will ensue;
he does all this during his dancing — the King and the Court are becoming rather
tipsy, and don't pay him much attention —Jenny Pigtail pours some of the
bottle's contents into the bowl, and hands it about — all drink and become
drowsy — at last they all hang their heads simultaneously at one note, and
Friday beckons in Robinson Crusoe ; he enters, L. U. E.</stage>
