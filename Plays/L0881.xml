<head>ACT I. </head>
<stage>Scene.—Interior of saloon, in the Château Beauregard, opening into
Conservatory—the saloon is richly decorated, style Louis
Quinze—panels—ceiling—screens, painted àla Watteau or Boucher—stands of
flowers—tables—couches—statuettes, &amp;c., &amp;c. (all light and elegant)
scattered about—mirrors reflect and give depth to scene—the conservatory full of
plants in flower, their brilliancy of colour relieved and softened by several
statues on pedestals.</stage>
<stage>Plumeau, in handsome livery, discovered dusting furniture with feather
brush.</stage>
<sp who="#L0881_M7">
<speaker>Plum.</speaker>
<stage> (dusting, lazily)</stage>
<p>There! I think I've done enough for to day. I wasn't born to work; that's a
fact. When madame hired me in Paris, it was distinctly understood, I was for
ornament; but now we're down in the country, she looks for utility. She'll be
disappointed. <stage>(dusting statue down stage, L.)</stage> So this is Apoller,
as is spoken of for his figger. Bah! put Apoller in livery, I should like to see
how he'd look then. <stage>(complacently)</stage> It's the uniform as tests the
man. <stage>(moves about, still dusting)</stage> I wonder what made the countess
quit Paris in such a hurry. Since old Count Beauregard did the amiable thing,
leaving madame, young, rich, and a widder, she's been as capricious as the new
barometer, that Mr. Copernicus Kopp has just hung up in the hall, which sticks
to nothing but change, and must be studied by the rules of contrairy.
<stage>(throwing himself on couch, R.)</stage> Now, if I was a rich young
widder, I'd—</p>

<speaker>Fichu.</speaker>
<stage> (heard off stage, L.)</stage>
<p>This way—this way!<stage>Fichu enters, L.</stage>Lor! Monsieur Plumeau, is
that you?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M7">
<speaker>Plum.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Madame Fichu, it's as much as is left of me. I find the country air too
exhausting. Early rising and regular habits are killing me. You were speaking to
something when you entered—one of the natives, I presume?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F21">
<speaker>Fichu.</speaker>
<p>Monsieur Molasse's servant.</p>

<p>The retired grocer! <stage>(rising languidly)</stage> Really, if   madame
isn't a little more choice in her acquaintance, I must resign.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F21">
<speaker>Fichu.</speaker>
<p>Hush! <stage>(turning to door, L.)</stage> Come in, Monsieur Mouton.</p>
<stage>Mouton, a peasant, long hair, sheepish face, high collared short waisted
coat—comes stamping in, L.—he wears sabots.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M8">
<speaker>Mout.</speaker>
<p>Here I am. <stage>(he comes a little down stage, then halts in wonderment at
the gorgeous appearance of Plumeau)</stage> Well, I never!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M7">
<speaker>Plum.</speaker>
<p>I suppose not. <stage>(walking round and surveying him
superciliously)</stage> How wonderful are the works of nature. <stage>(posing
before Mouton)</stage> Don't often see a person like me in these parts?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M8">
<speaker>Mout.</speaker>
<p>No; I've only seen one before, an' he were jack-pudding to a travelling
doctor.</p>

<p>Barbarian!</p>

<sp who="#L0881_F21">
<speaker>Fichu.</speaker>
<stage> (pushing Mouton)</stage>
<p>Don't stand there with your mouth like a round O in a copy book, and all your
fingers pointing different ways like a sign post. What are you afraid of?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M8">
<speaker>Mout.</speaker>
<p>I a'n't afraid. I'm 'stonished, that's all. I'm always 'stonished.
<stage>(laughing sheepishly)</stage> It's a way I've got. <stage>(pulling out
note)</stage> Here's the compliments of Monsieur and Madame Molasse, an' they'll
be here in an hour, to wait upon the Countess Beauregard. </p>

<sp who="#L0881_F21">
<speaker>Fichu.</speaker>
<stage> (sharply)</stage>
<p>One would think you read it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M8">
<speaker>Mout.</speaker>
<p>O' course I have; I'd nothing else to do on the road.</p>
<stage>                                        Exit after Fichu, R.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M7">
<speaker>Plum.</speaker>
<stage> (coming down stage)</stage>
<p>Good—very good—the brute   has parts, if cultivated. <stage>(laughter in
conservatory at back)</stage> The Countess! it's really too bad. You don't hear
such laughter as that in Paris—very coarse merriment, very.</p>
<stage>                                        Exit, L. with gesture of despair,
as the Countess and Julie D'Aumont, enter from conservatory; the former,
coquettishly attired in a semi-Arcadian (demi-Watteau costume)—the latter in
rich travelling toilette—the Countess eating cherries.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (as they come down stage)</stage>
<p>Laugh on, dear, I am always happy to contribute to the amusement of my
friends.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Don't be angry, Clare; but I must laugh, to think that I should have met that
pearl of fashion, and queen of ton the Countess Beauregard, perched upon the
back of a shambling donkey, between two baskets of cherries, one on each side,
to preserve her balance.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>I confess the donkey, but deny the <pb n="5"/> shamble. Fatigued with a long
walk, I accepted the offer of a good-natured peasant woman, and was returning
home in true Arcadian fashion, when, to my joyful surprise, I met you.
<stage>(taking both Julie's hands)</stage> Tell me to what lucky chance I am
indebted for this visit, which I hope to make a long one?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>A chance indeed. I was on my way to join our old friend, the Baroness
d'Antin, who is holding quite a little court of her own at Eaudouce.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>The bathing place a dozen miles from here?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Exactly. But halting to change horses at this village, I heard by accident,
that you were the owner of this estate; and so, dear friend and schoolfellow, I
renounced the Baroness for a time and—am here.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (embracing her)</stage>
<p>Nor shall you speedily depart.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>  It is now my turn to put a question. May I ask the reason of your sudden
disappearance from society and Paris?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (eating cherries)</stage>
<p>I have but a woman's reason to offer—caprice!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Which, of course, as a woman, I am slow to believe. I suspect an affair of
the heart!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Heart. My dear Julie, you are talking of society and Paris, where such an
adjunct to one's anatomy is found only in a fossil state, preserved in cabinets
of curiosities.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Yet all the world said—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Nothing worth listening to, be assured. Ah, Julie, the little of belief still
left to society is reserved for calumny alone.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>But—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Seized with a sudden disgust for the artificial, I resolved upon studying the
natural, so placing those two curious specimens of art, Fichu and Plumeau,
outside my travelling carriage, I mounted inside, and somehow—I scarcely know
how—found my way here.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>A delightful place!—but the natives?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>A most docile race, that from living in continual companionship with the
cattle have caught much of their dumbness and placidity. When any of the
inhabitants do make a descent upon you—they either sit silent for hours like a
circle of Druidical stones, or all open upon you at once like   a kennel of
hounds at feeding time.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>You, at least, have not changed.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>I'd a visit from one of the chiefs of the tribe only this morning, and he sat
staring at me thus—with a face round and blank as a Dutch clock, and, to
complete the simile, he only sounded twice within the hour, once to tell me the
time of day, and once to instruct me as to the probable state of the
weather.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>But you have another neighbour of whom you have <pb n="6"/> not yet told
me—the proprietor of that white house which overlooks the river.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (with assumed carelessness)</stage>
<p>The General Lacroix.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Hercules Lacroix! I have heard my father speak of him—a brave old soldier;
and also, if my memory serves me well <stage>(she places hand on Countess's arm
and glances archly into her face)</stage> the uncle of Felicien Doucet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Is he here?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>The general—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>No! Felicien.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (half laughing)</stage>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<stage> (laughing)</stage>
<p>Nothing—only the clouds are beginning. to disperse. <stage>(her manner
changes into one of affectionate kindness)</stage> Clare! Clare! you must not
attempt to deceive me. All Paris talked of Felicien's love for you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (coldly)</stage>
<p>  All Paris was mistaken then.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<stage> (seriously)</stage>
<p>Of one thing I am sure. Pardon the frankness of a friend—almost of a
sister—but—</p>
<stage>(she hesitates)</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>You loved him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>I?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Nay—I will spare you the pain of an avowal—that blush is more eloquent than
words.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Well then, I loved him—<stage>(she takes Julie's hands)</stage> and I love
him still!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<stage> (gaily)</stage>
<p>And he?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (letting her hands fall)</stage>
<p>Loves me no longer.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible—has another usurped?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<stage> (quickly)</stage>
<p>Oh, no, no; I am sure of that! <stage>(with a growing agitation)</stage> yet
I will be satisfied—and I have a means!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">
<speaker>Julie.</speaker>
<p>What means?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>His uncle.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F14">

<p>General Lacroix!—a confirmed woman-hater!</p>

<sp who="#L0881_F13">

<stage> (smiling)</stage>
<p>But now a captive to my bow and spear.</p>

<p>The lion in love? impossible!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>Hopelessly entangled. <stage>(they both laugh)</stage> In his noble
simplicity of heart he sees nothing that is passing around him, and believes
that his nephew and I have met here for the first time—seeing this, and
irritated—justly irritated—by Felicien's change of manner and strange
indifference, I determined   to—</p>

<sp who="#L0881_F14">

<p>Play the uncle against the nephew?</p>

<p>She changed her mind.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M1">

<p>No, madame, I changed mine. I met the lady at a ball, and fell in love with
her beautiful hair. It was the most beautiful hair I ever saw—<stage>(glancing
at Countess)</stage> with one exception; and when the dance was over it had
twined itself so tightly round my heart, that it left me only breath to whisper
my love in her ear; and at parting a gentle pressure of her hand told me that I
might hope. My leave of absence expired on the next day. I determined to bring
affairs to a crisis, so the morning saw me at her gate. There was no need of
ceremony, for her father and I had served together in Algiers. I crossed the
lawn and entered—unannounced—the breakfast room. To my astonishment, Sophie—her
name was   Sophie—was there and alone.</p>
</sp>

<p>And you proposed in due form?</p>
</sp>

<p>I did nothing of the kind—for, in place of my charmer of the previous night,
I beheld a tame, expressionless girl, with a head like a gigantic firework; her
beautiful hair had all disappeared, and in its place I saw only a forest of
papers the very rustling of which haunted my dreams for months after.</p>

<p>Madame! the illusion was gone, and marriage stood before me in its blank
reality. Her beauty was not for the domestic eye, but was only brought out from
its cases and papers with the robes and jewels and other adornments. I stammered
something—an adieu of some kind, and fled. Thunder! having witnessed the
cooking—I'd no longer an appetite for the dish.</p>

<p>I confess the enemy too strong for me. Why, the very shops—and I studied them
well when in Paris, gave me a glimpse into the depth of the enemy's strategy,
and I recoiled in terror. And ever afterwards, if I found my resolution melting
away before the fire of a pair of bright eyes, I strengthened myself with the
reflection that, perhaps, after all my heart had been set beating and my sleep
disturbed by attractions which were derived from the bone of the whale and the
tail of the horse. Ah! madame, our modern beauties   defy Time, and with reason,
for they have an inexhaustible arsenal in the toilette.</p>

<head>ACT II. </head>
<stage>Scene.—Semi-interior room in the house of General Lacroix, opening upon a
verandah overgrown with creeping-plants in flower; light pillar supports; a lawn
beyond, with shrubbery. In verandah, and on lawn, orange trees in tubs; in
distance a beautiful landscape; in extreme distance the sea, flecked with
sunlight and dotted with sails. The room itself plainly but solidly furnished.
In conspicuous places large busts of the Napoleons I. and III.; the walls
decorated with plans of fortifications, &amp;c. and arms (modern) of various
kinds; a large copy of David's picture, Napoleon crossing the Alps, over
chimney. Any other military pictures can be hung about, so as to add to the
character of the mise-en-scene—doors R. and L.</stage>
<stage>Lacroix seated near table, down stage, a newspaper is at his feet, as if
fallen from his hands, which rest listlessly upon his knees; his whole
appearance that of one lost in a deep and painful reverie; he is in undress, his
whole aspect entirely changed from that in Act I. Sergeant Pons up stage, L.,

to the other, listening to'em—thousand bayonets! it's been a bad night for all.

<p>This, and all this contained in that one word— coquette. Man claims all,
usurps all but that narrow domain, in which we reign supreme. Society is woman's
battle-field; and the coquetry that dazzles and confounds, is often but the
glittering veil which woman's pride throws over a tortured heart.</p>

<p>What! Would you look for a woman's heart upon her lips? we feel acutely; more
acutely than man can feel; yet, are early taught it is a crime, to express
either by word or look, the feelings of the heart. Concealment is the girl's
first lesson—Nature is sent to school, to wear a backboard, and put a padlock on
her tongue. Why wonder then with such a teaching, if we are hypocrites perforce,
almost from the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p>I was second in a duel of which you were one of the principals. My friend was
a young man, a mere boy. The quarrel was over a gaming table; he had accused
you, Baron de Fauconville, and accused you with truth, of cheating.</p>

<sp who="#L0881_M1">
<speaker>Lacroix.</speaker>
<stage> (very calm)</stage>
<p>All in good time, Monsieur de Fauconville—at least hear out my story. The
result was, as I have said, you met in the wood of Couci. The first fire was
his—he missed—not from want of courage, but from lack of skill. You were more
fortunate; with deliberate cruelty you placed your hand on that child's heart.
“You are very brave,” you said, and there was a flush of pride upon his cheek.
“Have you a mother?” you asked, and there were tears in his eyes as he answered,
“Yes.” “I am sorry for her.” you added with a laugh, then took your place and
shot him through the heart; yes, like a coward and an assassin, you shot him,
through the heart.</p>

<p>All in good time, Monsieur de Fauconville. That   boy was the only son of a

lying dead— murdered!—upon the ground, I swore to kill you, Monsieur de
Fauconville.</p>

to my declaration of love—listened with eyes that beamed as I then thought, a
tender approval through their veil of tears, that Horace de Fauconville placed
in my hands the avowal of your love for another—for him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>You saw those letters?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_M3">

<p>I did! and knew the handwriting to be yours. They all spoke of a woman's love
for one who—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>A woman's love! a child's—a silly romantic child's. <stage>(speaking rapidly
and with indignation)</stage> I was in my fifteenth year, when I first met the
Baron de Fauconville, an accomplished man of the world; skilled in all those
arts which turn the head of a foolish girl, whose only world had been her
father's château, but whose young imagination had been fed on the bright day
dreams of the romancist, and the poet. What wonder then that my vanity was
touched by the simulated passion of this man, and that with all the imprudence
of youth, knowing no harm, and therefore dreaming of none, I wrote   some
letters, undated, and bearing only the signature of Clare!</p>

<p>Why not have trusted in that honour to have defended yours, and have crushed

</sp>
<sp who="#L0881_F13">
<speaker>Countess.</speaker>
<p>I dared not. Oh! think, Felicien, I was a woman and alone, placed by my
husband's name and fortune in a position which made me a special mark for
jealous and envious eyes. I had no friend to advise me—not one—and shrunk from
that fiery ordeal which even innocence cannot pass through unscathed. It was
then I stooped to purchase—yes, I purchased with money the silence he refused to
give.</p>

<p>I have said I was alone. My husband was rich   and generous, and it was long
ere my purse was exhausted; but De Fauconville had also his demon—one as
grasping and remorseless as himself—the demon of gaming. My money was poured out
like water—the source grew dry—still he demanded more. “I have no more,” I said.
“You have jewels,” he answered, and—and—<stage>(she pauses, her voice broken by
emotion)</stage> Alas! who, among the many who pressed around my chair, saw,
while they gazed upon the smiling coquette, the grim Medusa visage that was
turning her heart to stone—the dark and threatening shadow ever at her side.</p>
