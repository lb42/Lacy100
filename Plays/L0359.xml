<stage>Scene I.—A view by a river side; on the opposite bank are seen the backs
of houses—immersed in water, as at Blackwall, &amp;c.</stage>

<stage type="entrance">Enter Tom, with a large hamper, L. H.</stage>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Come, this will do; though its utility exceeds its beauty; a confoundedly
ugly basket, though destined to hold most rare contents: several sugar loaves, a
canister of tea—black and green, almonds and raisins in abundance, coffee, rice,
and spices, bars of soap, starch and powder, blue enough to stock a small shop.
Dear Fanny! if her heart is not won by such a store of valuables, it is indeed
hard.</p>
</sp>

<stage type="entrance">Enter Reckless, L. H.</stage>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, I’ve found her—What you here?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>I have found her, I’ll tell you; congratulate your fortunate master, most
faithful Thomas.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Have you indeed found Miss Julia, and how?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Simply saw her at a house window.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>But you cannot get into that house.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>No; but I have got my mark, the means of hitting that mark are still in
fortune’s hands.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>And in worse hands they could not be; sir, do give up this scheme. You fall
in love with a young lady at a boarding school, correspond with her under a
feigned name—</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you know that arose from the fear of my cousin, old Guineamore, hearing
of these matters. I dared not trust my own lady love. You are aware I have
immense expectations from him, and that he hates anything like adventures.</p>
</sp>

<pb n="4"/>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, and Reginald de Mowbray is a much prettier name than Ralph Reckless, but
where was I? Oh, a feigned name. Well, the young lady’s governess finds out the
correspondence, and very properly sends her to her guardians, who takes her into
the country, also very properly; give up this scheme, sir—</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Not I; when I have found the retreat of my charmer, the cavern where the
treasure is hid, shall I be craven knight enough to fear the dragon that guards
it? No, man, not I—so if you have not better advice to give, we’ll change the
subject. What the devil is that great basket for?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>What? oh, that is an affair of the heart; you have confided all your tender
secrets to me, therefore I will do the same to you, sir, if you will allow
me.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Certainly, good Thomas, go on.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Why, a sort of a relation of mine—a grocer, died the other day, without a
will, and his stock in trade got divided among six of us. I have borrowed this
large crate from Delfs, the crockery-warehouseman, to stow my share in; and am
thinking I could not do the genteel thing better, (as my sweetheart Fanny’s in
service, and has to find such articles out of her wages,) than to make her a
delicate present of the groceries, to sweeten my progress in her affections—eh,
sir?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Delicate indeed! that I should have so gallant a man in my service; and where
does this happy maiden reside?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>You see that white house, the other side of the water? one of those houses in
the water.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>What! the white one?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, she is housemaid there.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Oh! ha, ha, ha! Ri tol de rol. <stage>(dances.)</stage></p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Hey day. Did you tell me to order a straight waistcoat, sir?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>No! tol de rol, I have a thought—</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Why, you do look remarkable thoughtful.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>You see these three bright gold sovereigns?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir! perhaps you will allow me to <emph>feel</emph> them too?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>So I will, Tom, on one condition! send <emph>me</emph> in <pb n="5"/> that
basket instead of the grocery, and carry me to the house where my Julia is
secluded.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M3">
<speaker>Tom.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, but what will Fanny say?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_M2">
<speaker>Reck.</speaker>
<p>Never mind her, there shall be a genteel note pinned outside the basket,
explaining the contents. Then, I’ll give her a couple of sovereigns, so pack up
and be gone.</p>

<stage>Scene Ii.—A parlour.—In centre of stage a sofa, capable of being made
into a bed. At the back a globe, covered with a glazed cover. A dining table and
chair. A cupboard to open at top and bottom, R.—A large window to open,

<stage>(Mrs. Facile, with a pestle and mortar, and Julia, R. H.,
discovered.</stage>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>Really, my dear, the best advice I can give you, is to employ yourself about
something, it will divert your mind.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Divert? I don’t want to be diverted, I want to be miserable; it’s very unkind
of you to try to console me.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>I can only say I mean well, and I believe your guardian means well.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Yes, so is every horrid thing <emph>meant</emph> well. Our governess used to
make us wash our hands in icy water in winter, and tell us it was all for our
good. I hate what is for our good.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>But consider the impropriety of your forming at school, a clandestine
attachment with a young gentleman, of whose very residence you are ignorant.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>And what is propriety? A creature of imagination, framed by old maids under
the inspiration of green tea.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>Stop, stop—</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Oh, what times were those, when I used to look for a note from Mowbray, in
the key hole of the green gate, when I used to read it to six especial
confidants, who were all dying with envy; ’till one quarrelled <pb n="6"/> with
me about a slice of my last cake, betrayed me to the French teacher, who told
the head teacher, who told the governess—and then what an explosion! dragged off
hither, without letting me even send my address to De Mowbray. It is a fine
thing to be a victim of cruelty at seventeen. And now as you are so fond of
giving advice, let me ask you why you are so very severe to that unfortunate
little man, your husband?</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>What you call severity, arises from my strict sense of propriety, of which I
am sorry to say, Mr. Facile has not so strict a sense.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>No! why for all I can see, the poor dear little man does nothing but sit with
his mathematical books before him all day, looking just like our geography
master. Then he is such a very easy man.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>The very thing I dread; he not only lets me have my own way, but every one
else too. He is the confidant of all the young ladies in the village; the very
servants ask his advice on every single point, and he gives it—is never
affronted.</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F8">
<speaker>Julia.</speaker>
<p>Dear, good-natured soul!</p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L0359_F7">
<speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
<p>There’s that Fanny Pepper has innumerable points to consult him upon—a
forward slut, who apes me in everything. If I wear ringlets, she wears
ringlets—makes her caps like mine. Now how do I know what she may ask him—and if
he can refuse nothing—think of that!</p>

Fanny the housemaid?</p>

<p>I can’t find the door. Some one must have taken it off its hinges.</p>

<p>Yes, and that cursed fellow is going to hallo.</p>

<p>I am De Mowbray; my real name is Reckless. This letter will convince you I

<p>Why this gentleman has been twice killed. I’ll tell you all at breakfast; now

not to dream.</p>

<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, that you’ve seen my friend, Reckless “Twice
Killed,” let us hope that you will, at length, allow him to live
uninterruptedly—uninterruptedly, did I say? No; for if my innocent delinquencies
did serve to amuse you, I shall feel the greatest pleasure in killing him twice
more to-morrow.</p>
