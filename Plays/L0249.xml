    <stage>Scene.— The Garden of a Country Inn — Low wall at back, with gate and stile, C.— Beyond
     the wall an omnibus, L.H.— The Inn, R.3 E., with window and balcony on first floor—A sign board
     hanging from a projecting rod, with inscription "The Railway Inn" — Table and benches, R.H.— An
     old water-butt near the Inn, L.H.— Railway whistle heard without. </stage>
    <sp who="#L0249_M5">
     <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(discovered at table R.)</stage> Here's the London train. <stage>(at door of
       Inn)</stage> Now then! look alive—water the coffee!</p>
     <stage> Exit into Inn, L.H.</stage>
     <stage> Enter Biffin and Clara, C. from R. over stile. </stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(R.)</stage> Well, here we are at last, and a good thing too. If I wasn't a peaceable
      man I should have exploded, I know I should!—That fellow worried me beyond all endurance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(C.)</stage> Not a bit more than he did me. papa, I assure you, and he trod on my
      foot, and nearly smashed it into the bargain.</p>
     <stage> Enter Peter from Inn, L.H.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M5">
     <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
     <p><stage> (L.)</stage> Going to stop here, Sir ?—excellent accommodation within—charming view
      of the railroad, Sir !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Thank you, no, we are going on to Bognor.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M5">
     <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
     <p>To Bognor, Sir ?—take any refreshment before the omnibus starts, Sir ?—first rate sirloin of
      beef just in cut, Sir—splendid cold ham, Sir—be-au-tiful pigeon pie, Sir.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Have you got any coffee ?</p>

     <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
     <p>Coffee, Sir ?—plenty, magnificent coffee, Sir!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>But genuine, good coffee, I mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M5">
     <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
     <p>Couldn't be better, Sir, we don't put anything in it, I assure you, Sir.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Then get us two cups of coffee, very hot.</p>
     <stage> Exit Peter into Inn, L.</stage>
     <p>—But tell me, Clara, who on earth is this fellow who has fastened himself upon us, all the
      way from London ?—and where did you make his acquaintance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(C.)</stage> Me, papa ? I never saw him before in my life.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>The deuce you didn't! I made sure you must have met him before somewhere.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p>I havn't the slightest idea who he is, and his attentions were excessively disagreeable to
      me, I assure you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>And to me too—he was so confoundly obsequious. I can't bear such excessively polite
      people.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p>I think he saw that we didn't like it, and persevered on purpose to annoy us.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>I think so too. I believe he was making game of us all the while, and if I wasn't a
      peaceable man, I should have exploded—I am sure I should.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p>How was it possible to be angry—he was always laughing.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Very true; besides, one can't very well quarrel with a man because he's too attentive to
      you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p>Of course not. But he's perfectly insufferable.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Just now, too, when I was going to call a porter for our luggage he wouldn't let me, but
      insisted upon taking charge of it himself, and I didn't much like it, because you see, there
      are five packages, and there's a good bit of money in my portmanteau.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_F8">
     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious, papa, if he should be a thief ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Oh dear! I never thought of that. You've put me in a cold shiver, and I'll run and look
      after him this very minute. <stage>(going C.)</stage></p>
     <stage> Enter Sam Naggins, C.from R.U.E. over stile, carrying portmanteau, parcels, bandboxes,
      &amp;c. — He has a green paletot on his arm. </stage>

    <sp who="#L0249_M1">
     <speaker>Nag.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(C.)</stage> Why you don't mean to say, you were getting
      <pb n="4"/>impatient. There are your five packages—they are heavy —frightfully heavy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(R.)</stage> I don't know who asked you to trouble yourself with them, Sir ;—I could
      easily have found a porter.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M1">
     <speaker>Nag.</speaker>
     <p>A porter ! nonsense, he would have turned everything topsy-turvy, and it would have cost you
      sixpence at the very least.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M3">
     <speaker>Bif.</speaker>
     <p>Rot the sixpence, there are some moments when I would rather pay.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0249_M1">
     <speaker>Nag.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, very well! if you would rather have it that way, I can easily take them back again, and
      you can send for them when you like. <stage>(takes up portmanteau)</stage>

     <p>Ha, ha, ha! he's superb, upon my soul—he's worthy of a glass case in the Crystal Palace—that
      he is! I've been teazing him in this way all the way from London —seventy miles—and by a slow
      train, too. Two hours and a half of incessant aggravation. I wonder what he thinks of it all ?
      I dare say, now, he says to himself, " Who the devil is this fellow who has fastened himself
      upon us with such horrible pertinacity ?—he must be in love with my daughter, that's very
      certain." Me in love when I've
      <pb n="8"/>made up my mind not to marry till I am seventy-five, and want to settle down to a
      quiet life! I'm only an aggravating fellow, that's all. Sam Naggins, clerk in the Post Office,
      absent on leave—good-natured, but fond of fun— not a bad-hearted chap, but aggravating as a
      hornet. Every man has his mission; mine is to teaze my neighbours —all for fun, though—and I
      act up to it gloriously. I practise the cornet till two in the morning—that aggravates my
      landlady : I'm as healthy as a ploughboy—that aggravates my doctor: I've sworn to live a
      bachelor till I'm seventy-five—that aggravates the spinsters; and I never pay a bill till I'm
      summoned—that aggravates my tradesmen. I was just starting on a visit to Stonehenge by the
      London and South Coast. People so often say to me, "What do you think of Stonehenge? isn't it
      sublime?" to which I answer, "Umph ! so so—a tidy ruin, but nothing in it!" only to aggravate
      them, for I never saw it in my life. But I'm going to see it now, for I've a passion for
      antiquities, especially very dilapidated ones,—that's the reason Old Biffin so charmed me the
      moment I set eyes upon him at the London Bridge Station. At the first glance I saw a splendid
      opening in my peculiar line—a sober, steady old shop-keeper, and a simpering bread-and-butter
      Miss fresh from boarding-school—two placid countenances, with predestined victim written in
      every feature. I fastened myself upon them at once, took a seat opposite to them in the same
      carriage, and overpowered them with civilities. I saw that it teazed them—that was quite
      enough for me. I redoubled my aggravations—lent them Bradshaw, and persuaded them to follow
      our route in the time table, read them the City article in the "Times," and the President's
      message, tormented them by incessant assiduity, and pestered them with delicate attentions,
      till the young lady didn't know which way to look, and the old gentleman's eyes were starting
      out of his head with rage. It was glorious! Thanks to this incomparable couple, I never spent
      two merrier hours in my life. However, I've done with them now—they're bound for Bognor, and
      I'm off to Stonehenge. <stage>(goes up C.)</stage></p>

      <pb n="21"/>it was green half an hour ago, and now it's drab ! I suppose the blue has flown ;

      out of sight entirely. Let's inspect the pockets. (takes a letter from pocket of paletot) A

     <p>No signs of them yet ! Never mind, everything is prepared for their reception—thanks to my
      activity. The notion of my brother's wanting to marry Clara to an American ! But she's not
      married to him yet, and what's more I don't intend she ever shall be. I've a pet little plan
      of my own. Simon must have received my letter before this, and if he only follows my
      instructions — Poor little Simon! I promised his aunt, my dear old schoolmistress, to watch
      over her orphan nephew when she was gone, and I've kept my word; but I dare not do much for
      him openly—the world is so malicious ! heaven knows what people might say if I did. However,
      if I can only secure him Clara's fortune, he'll be comfortably settled for life: he'll make
      her an excellent husband, too, I'm sure he will, for he's a good- hearted little fellow,
      though he isn't the brightest genius in the world. Here they are at last, and a stranger with
      them--I wonder who it can be ?</p>

     <p>Well, I suppose I must consent; but if I am to have you for a son-in-law, I'll give up being

     <p>]That's right, make the best of what you can't
      <pb n="46"/>help—it's the wisest plan. Well, I've made a capital day's work of it—I've secured
      a nice little wife and a snug little fortune, and all through aggravation! I've found my
      happiness as they find coal—by <hi>boring</hi> for it. <stage>(to Audience)</stage>] Only look
      at them all—don't they look miserable ? and no wonder, for I've aggravated them horribly! Old
      Biffin's vexed because he's got a son-in-law that he doesn't like— Arabella's plagued because
      I've found her out and marred all her plans—Simon's annoyed because he hasn't got the wife he
      wanted, and Popplewig's worried because he's got the wife he didn't want—and it's all through
      me! How they must love me ! There's one thing I hope though, and that is, I haven't bored you:
      I'm an aggravating fellow, I know, but I mean to reform—I'm going to turn over a new leaf and
      lead a model life, but before I begin I should like one last bit of aggravation. I want to
      persuade you to applaud this piece—not for the sake of the author, I don't care a button for
      him—but on account of his rivals—they will be so frightfully aggravated. Will you oblige me ?—
      Thank you!</p>
