     <p>When one's in love one is always doing stupid things. There, now—if I haven't put the salt
      into the milk jug—and then I dream such stupid things. Last night, now, I dreamt that Robin
      Grist, master's head man—who's for ever making love to me, quite against my inclination—was
      absolutely turned into a white donkey, and that I gave him a lapful of thistles to eat, which
      pricked his mouth, poor fellow! Ha! ha! Oh, dear! I've nearly upset the sugar into the
      mustard. It's all Robin's fault—first with the cream, then the sugar, and Robin—<stage>Enter

      handsome young man—very   amiable—very superior to the young men here about; and after having
      received so many polite attentions from him, one can't help feeling interested about him. Then
      he has become so attached to my father, and my father so attached to him—I can't help liking
      him on my father's account. He insists on my father calling him <pb n="4"/> Henry, as though he were his
      son; and he insists on my calling him Henry, as if I were his sister. <stage>(sighs)</stage>

     <p>I can well reiterate your sentiments, sir—I that have been living in my kind old
      grandfather's mill, man and boy, now fifty years. I went to London once: I was choked with the
      smoke—deafened by the noise—hardened as my sense of hearing was by the click of my own mill—it
      sounded to me, carriage after carriage rolling through the vast streets, like the warning of a
      perpetual earthquake. How happy was I when I found myself once   again on the roof of the
      coach, which, conducted me to my old peaceful dwelling, and the unmatched comfort of its
      fireside. My wife, my child—even the dog and cat seemed like old blessings restored to me, as
      the one licked my hands, the other sat purring in the chimney corner. Ha! ha!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0179_M2">

     <p>What a delightful picture of domestic happiness! Oh! for a wife and child in such a chimney

     <speaker>Michael.</speaker>
     <p> (L.)But like all earthly dreams, such happiness is not to last in this world. My poor wife
      was taken from me— suddenly too. I was too content. It was a warning—I felt it such. She
      sleeps there, in the old churchyard, by the side of my father and mother, where I hope one day
      to sleep as calmly myself.</p>

      supply our wants, and add something more for you, and the winter of your old father's years:
      people looked on from the summit of the hill—they contemplated the peaceful scene, and said,
      “Truly, the miller who dwells there is a happy man; while yon stream flows on, nothing can
      disturb his competence, or o'ershadow his happiness.” Alas, alas! even while they spoke, the
      serpent, Monopoly, lay hidden, as it were, beneath the very waters which glittered in their

     <p>Thank you. Thank you all, but before everything, thanks to him who brings me back my
      child—let them speculate, let them monopolize as they please; the world may look on and laugh,
      but, after all, your poor integrity is still more sustaining to the heart than the rich man's
      proudest fallacy; the one with golden chains, 'tis true links us to the world, the other on
      holy wing lifts us up to heaven.</p>
