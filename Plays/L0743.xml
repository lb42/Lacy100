    <stage>Enter Hannah, L. D. carrying two dishes—over her arm hang a brace of pheasants.</stage>

     <p>There's the birds <stage>(placing them on side table)</stage> as has just come; and there's

      put the 'am upon the table. <stage>(she stands before table)</stage> Now that's very strange.
      As sure as love is loss of appetite that 'am this 'and placed upon that table—I'd lay my best
      new gown on it! When I went into the kitchen for the hot hamlet and the cold grouse-pie, I
      says to myself, “Master has gone out for his constitution, but missus will be down directly,
      so hup with the hamlet, cook, my dear, this instant!” and cook turns round from the fire and
      says to me, “Hannah,” says she—<stage>(leaves table open to the sight of the Audience—the pie
      has disappeared —she screams)</stage> The pie's gone! The place is bewitched! Ghosts is in the
      'ouse, and I give warning as sure as Dreams and Death-watches. <stage>(she sits against table,
      leaning her head on her hand so as to hide the omelette)</stage> I never stirred from the
      spot. No thief could done it—I see none! The 'am and the pie 'as both gone off together! What
      will missus say? She won't believe me! She'll think I've give it to Berlinns. I stay in no
      house which is haunted, and so I'll tell the cook. They was a murder committed in the next
      county but one only four
      <pb n="4"/>years ago—and 'ams and pies don't disappear for nothing. <stage>(turns round and
      finds the omelette gone—screams and throws her apron over head)</stage> </p>

     <p>Oh, ay—so I did. Well, Pluxie and I rowed about for some time, till I got to feel very

      into a pub—</p>

     <p>A what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0743_M1">
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>A public—a public house, you know, by the river side, just above Chesterton, about four
      miles from Cambridge. Well, we had some swizzle, and a pipe, and proposed returning—we went
      down to the boat, and saw it in the middle of the river with a bargee in it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0743_F4">
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>A what?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0743_M1">
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>A bargee—a bargeman, lighterman—a boatman amusing himself with our boat, to the intense
      gratification of some other blackguards, his friends, on the other side the bank. “Hallo!”
      says Pluxie. “How dare you take that liberty?” Bargee kept on, never minding us. “Come out of
      that boat this instant!” shouted Pluxie, waxing wrath. Bargee looked at him and said “I'll see
      you—” But I won't shock your feelings,   Polly, by repeating what he said. No! his language is
      easier imagined than described. The way in which that bargee swore was worthy of the American
      House of Congress. He was as abusive as a patriot, and ten times dirtier. “You come ashore,”
      sings out Pluxie, who stands five feet four, “and I'll give you a good licking.” Well, at that
      the bargee laughs and all his friends—the other blackguards laugh, too. This, of course, rose
      Pluxie's dander to boiling point, and at last the bargee pulled to land to fight. Bargee stood
      six feet two, and was broad out of proportion. We adjourned to a meadow. One of bargee's
      friends did the amiable for him—Pluxie was waited on by yours truly. <stage>(warming with the
      description)</stage> The men peeled—It was a grand sight to see little
      <pb n="10"/> Pluxie square up to the giant as cool and collected as a Don during examination.
      Talk of chivalry—but never mind that, I'll come to the point, Polly, directly—don't be afraid,
      Pluxie was in fine condition, but bargee had too much flesh. After some chaff and a little
      feinting, bargee opened the ball with his left, broke through Pluxie's guard, and Pluxie went
      grasswards—four to one on bargee —but perhaps you never read <hi>Bell's Life</hi>?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0743_F4">
     <speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
     <p>No—what is it? A romance?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0743_M1">
     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
     <p>No, a newspaper, full of fancy, and often dealing in fiction—a modern Homer's Iliad,
      published in   weekly parts, price sixpence—however, as you've not been coached up to be
      Romany of the King, I'll translate. Pluxie was soon licked—out of time—nowhere—what could a
      little fellow do against a giant? Now I never could see a row without wanting to be in it
      myself. I had been second—I now offered my services as principal —bargee accepted. We had some
      grog together—shook hands, and toed the scratch.</p>

     <p>I did. In the thirteenth round I hit bargee full butt where he puts his beer, and he
      fell—time was called—but bargee couldn't come to time. I was declared victor. I borrowed a
      sov. from Pluxie to give to bargee —he was speechless—we poured grog down his throat
      —useless—<stage>(seizing her hand excitedly)</stage> Polly, bargee was dead!</p>

     <p>I killed him! In the eye of the law I was —I <hi>am</hi> a murderer! Conceive my feelings!
      Bargee's friends behaved like trumps. They said it was in fair fight—but the question was what
      was to be done? It was agreed that I should bolt—Pluxie was to return to college to evade
      suspicion, and I was to make across country to the coast. I had presence of mind enough to
      give Pluxie this address, and he will write to me under   cover to you. Bargee's friends
      picked him up and promised, though they should be compelled to tell the truth to the
      authorities, to give me all the start they could. I ran as fast as I could eastward, thinking
      that your house was not out of my route—and here I am!</p>

      night—sleeping in the daytime—the first day in a dry ditch—the second, by way of a change, in
      a damp dyke. I daren't go near a house to ask or purchase anything to eat. I got here last
      night, or rather this morning about two o'clock—recognised the house by your

     <p>I broke into it. After murder, burglary's a trifle. I found I could open a shutter by the

      know—I got into this room.   The day broke, but I hadn't broke my fast for two days. I heard
      somebody coming, and crept under the table. When your girl laid breakfast—I couldn't resist
