     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Then tell me quickly. Did you put the note where I told you ?</p>

     <p>No, my lady.</p>

     <p>No!</p>

     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Pray forgive me, my lady; but indeed I couldn't help it. It was all along of John Duck ?</p>

     <p>John Duck ?</p>

    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, my lady, our man—he—he would try to kiss me, my lady, and I ran away, and he ran after
      me, and somehow or another, I lost it, my lady.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Lost my note! What is to be done ? You have destroyed me!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, don't say so, my lady. Nobody's likely to find it, I'm sure, if I couldn't, for I hunted
      all about the road where I must have dropped it. Such a tiny bit of paper, and if they do,
      what can any one make of it ? There's no name, outside or inside, and only one line, u
      To-night at eight o'clock in the parlour of the inn."</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>But one line, one word, in such times as these, is sufficient to endanger the liberty,
      perhaps life of the writer, and then, the Major—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, it's all right about the Major, my lady. When. I couldn't find the note, I thought the
      best thing to do was to stop under the old tree I was to leave it in till the Major came for
      it; and didn't I sit there on pins and needles, my lady, till he did come, for I knew mother
      would give it me for staying out so long.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>He did come, then, and you saw him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <pb n="6"/>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>To be sure I did, my lady, and a monstrous handsome young man he is too. It would be a
      shocking pity if they chopped off such a head as he has got on his shoulders, I'm sure.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>But, dear Patty, what said be ? What passed between you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, he looked terribly scared when he saw me first, but I up and told him at once what I
      came about, and what was written in the note, by your ladyship, and then he brightened up, and
      said you might depend on his coming at eight o'clock, as you wished him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>So far, then, you have made up for the unfortunate loss of my note, which, provided it does
      not fall into the hands of Sir Richard Wroughton—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, he'd be jealous, I suppose, my lady ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Jealous! </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Why, yes, everybody down here says, the baronet is hugeously in love with you; and what's
      more, that you are going to be married to him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Indeed! </p>
    </sp>

     <p>Oh yes, but I tell 'em—</p>

     <p>Nothing, I hope, to awaken suspicion of—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, no, my lady, of course not; I'd die sooner. I only say, that if I was a young rich
      handsome widow, like your ladyship, I wouldn't marry such a cross, ugly, bad man, as Sir
      Richard—for he is a bad man—Now isn't he, my lady? Tho' he is your cousin, I've heard you
      say—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Beware, beware, my dear Patty, or you will ruin all my hopes, and involve yourself in
      trouble by such language. Sir Richard is as powerful as he is vindictive. He has purchased
      favor at Court by the betrayal and abandonment of his oldest and best friends. His pretended
      affection for me but masks his design upon the estates left me by my late husband, to which he
      would otherwise have succeeded. Did he suspect for a moment I had any personal motive in
      urging him to obtain the pardon of Major Murray, all would be lost; therefore, for mercy's
      sake be prudent.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F6">
     <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, my lady, I'll never open my lips again on the subject, let 'em say what they please.</p>

     <p>Never fear, my lady. He'll be here, I warrant him! He is certainly as fine a looking young
      man as you'd meet in a summer's day. Oh, a great deal handsomer than John Duck, but then,
      somehow, John Duck has got such a way with him--I do love John Duck, that's a fact, tho' I
      won't own it to him—because—what's the use ?—he's get no money, and mother won't let me marry
      him, I'm sure.</p>

     <p>How lucky it was that I met Saville; but for him I should have taken the other path through
      the wood, and consequently not have picked up this little scrap of paper, which confirms all
      my suspicions—"To-night, at 8 o'clock, in the parlour of the inn." No address—no signature ;
      but very like the hand-writing of my fair cousin, Lady Somerford, and if so, the place of
      appointment is here, for the Widow Pottle was her nurse, and is most likely to be in her
      confidence. Oh, woman! woman!—How truthful appeared her assertions that she knew nothing of
      Major Murray personally, that she was interested about him solely on his mother's account. I
      have since ascertained positively that she met him in Paris, and afterwards in Holland; and
      now, no doubt, she is in communication with him here, for he has been in England, I suspect,
      during the last six weeks. Oh, if I had but known this earlier ! However, I am yet in time,
      and my vengeance shall be all the greater. Yes, yes, my politic cousin, when for your sake I
      have obtained the free pardon of this Jacobite, you will throw off the mask, and give your
      hand and fortune to him into the bargain. Well, here is the pardon, signed most unwillingly by
      the King, at the strong
      <pb n="9"/>solicitation of my fast friend, the Duke of Newcastle; but it is not in your hands
      yet, Lady Somerford, and if I succeed in catching you and your lover together, I will tear
      this paper to pieces before your face, and hang the traitor on the nearest tree, as my

     <p>I could no longer endure the separation, and your last advices induced me to believe that

      my person is unknown in this part of the country. I have papers and a passport, setting
      <pb n="16"/>forth that I am Charles Vardeck, son of a merchant of Antwerp, with letters of
      recommendation to persons of credit in England.' I have between three and four hundred pounds

     <p>Ah !—there is your mistake ! In that interest lies the danger. Sir Richard Wroughton

      existed between us, he would exert all his influence with the Government not to obtain your

     <p>I have no doubt; although, as I have before told you, my interest in the matter arose from

     <p>Sir Richard! </p>

    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>Lady Somerford ! I am not to be duped. I am not to be trifled with. I know you love Edward
      Murray ; I know he is in England ; that you wrote to him to meet you
      <pb n="30"/>last night, at eight o'clock, at the inn in the forest. <stage>( shews
       note)</stage> You will not deny your handwriting.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>It would be useless. You have my secret; I do love Major Murray : loved him and was engaged
      to him before you preferred your suit to me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>Which you encouraged to secure my influence with the minister ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>I grant you have so far a right to complain of my conduct; but the life of the man I loved
      was at stake. I, too, might accuse of duplicity the suitor who professed affection for me but
      to become the master of my fortune. Be generous, Sir Richard, admit that mine was the worthier
      motive, and accept all that it is in my power to give, gratitude and friendship.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>It is not for the loser to alter the stakes. You played for love; I for money. The game is
      in my hands —assign to me the Somerford estates, and in exchange you shall have the
      pardon.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>You cannot, surely, insist on such a sacrifice.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>I do. There is the deed, duly prepared; will you sign?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>I will not. His Majesty has pardoned Major Murray—you have no power to harm him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>Not so fast! His Majesty most unwillingly signed the paper, not knowing that the attainted
      Jacobite had already set foot on English soil, and thereby forfeited his life to the law; not
      knowing that under the assumed name of Vardeck, he had obtained admission into' this mansion,
      in which he has been arrested and awaits the doom he has so audaciously courted.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_F4">
     <speaker>Lady S.</speaker>
     <p>Hah! but it it is signed—it is signed—it is in your hands, and you will not dare to injure a
      hair of his head!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0201_M1">
     <speaker>Sir R.</speaker>
     <p>Not dare! Ah, you defy me ! Look ye, Lady Somerford, here is a lighted taper—here I place
      the pardon of Edward Murray <stage>(places the pardon in the grate)</stage> sign that deed,
      and you are free to take it—refuse, and that instant I burn it before your face, well assured
      the King will not sign a second pardon. <stage>(holds the lighted taper close to the
