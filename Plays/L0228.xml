<head>Act I</head>
<div type="scene">
<stage> Scene I.— On one side of the stage, and near the extreme back, is a
picturesque Water Mill, with revolving wheel, beneath which is running a rapid
stream ; on the opposite side, R., but nearer to the audience, is a made-out
neat Cottage, with built porch covered with roses; at the far back of stage is
seen part of the Church and Churchyard, surrounded by a dwarf wall, within which
are seen tombs, &amp;c.; large window in church; near first entrance, L., and
opposite the Cottage, an open cart shed with straw spread in it.</stage>
<stage>As the curtain rises, day is just breaking, and a solo on the flute in
the orchestra gives the idea of the singing of the lark. The sun gradually rises
until its beams fall on the windows of the Church and surrounding objects; smoke
rises from the chimneys of the Mill and Cottage.</stage>
<stage> Several Persons pass with small bundles of food as if on their way to
labour, Colin with stable fork crosses to cart shed, and as he places the pitch
fork in the straw, Reuben Rags starts up, ragged but neat, L.</stage>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Rags!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> A bundle of 'em carefully tied up. I've paid every attention to the good old
maxim—a stitch in time saves nine—in fact my worldly wardrobe is like a
harlequin's jacket, all stitch and patch—neat, but not gaudy—spruce, but
spangleless. There's a hat!</p>
<stage> Showing hat made up with materials of both black and white beaver, in
fact a compound of two old hats of different colours. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> "What?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> A hat! You can't mistake it for anything else—does it look like a
wheelbarrow, Chawbacon ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Chawbacon! Who are you, I should like to know ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> Should you ? I am forced to admit that I am in the same position; I often
ask myself who I am, and up to the present moment I've not received any
satisfactory answer, but I suppose I'm somebody, or at any rate, ought to be
somebody. I think I must have had a father and mother, although I don't carry in
my memory the slightest remembrance of that interesting event, all I <pb n="4"/>know of the green days of my infancy is a faint recollection of a ditch and a
donkey—of being kicked into one by the heels of the other, and of being picked
out almost smothered in dirty duckweed.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> I know what you are—you are a Gipsey.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> That's a general application as regards race and doesn't apply to an
individual family—now you are a—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Well, what am I ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> Well, you're an individual specimen of an extensive class famed for
ploughing and pudding—'taters and turnips—cabbage and cattle—cows and corn; one
of the numerous necessary horde who get their bread by raising bread for others,
who generally live until they are too old for work, and then end the remnant of
their days in an independent retreat their labour has provided for them—the
parish workhouse.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Well, dang it, there's some truth in that, but we can't help it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> Yes you can.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> How?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> Drink less ale and buy penny publications.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Advice gratis, as our doctor says.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> And valued at about as much as it fetches—nix.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Slang !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> No—polite language taught by adversity to assist necessity—figurative and
melodious—one of the ancient tongues, so old that its origin is lost in the
darkness of the past, handed down by the present.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Ah! you're one too many for me—yet they say in our village I'm bright.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">

<p> Yes, bright as a blacking bottle !</p>

<l>Oh, don't you remember the school, Ben Bolt, </l>
<l>And the master, so kind and so true,</l>
<l>And the little nook by the clear running brook, </l>
<l>Where we gathered the flowers as they grew ?</l>
<l>O'er that master's sweet porch may the grass never grow, </l>
<l>Or the running brook never go dry,</l>

<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p> Turn up my nose at you! no, that I wouldn't, if you hadn't a rag to your
back ; you know, Reuben, I love you.</p>

<sp who="#L0228_M4">
<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Almost as much as you love Ben Bolt.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_F9">
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p> Respect, sir. <stage>( crosses, C.)</stage> But no, why should I be ashamed
to own it ? Why not rather be proud of it ? I do love Ben Bolt, with as pure a
love as ever sister bore for brother, shall I tell you why ? There, <stage>(
pointing to cottage)</stage> there stands the home of as good a man as ever the
world looked upon—our village schoolmaster.</p>

<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p> Christian Comfort.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_F9">
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p> Just so—when I wandered about a careless bare-footed child with no thought
but for the bright skies and the green fields, Ben, then a child like myself,
led me by the hand beneath that torch, and and asked the good man to give me
that blessing, which humanizes all—knowledge.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> And he gave it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_F9">
<speaker>Mary.</speaker>
<p> He did—he placed the little gipsy wanderer by the side of the child friend
that brought her, and with no pay but the grateful tears of her he taught and
fed, became a friend—a father to her—all this I owe to Ben, and my heart must be
cold indeed, if I love not him who did so much for me.</p>
<stage>Colin retires up stage. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0228_M6">
<speaker>Reuben.</speaker>
<p> And you have remained with the old gentleman and his daughter ever since,
proving your gratitude by dusting out cupboards and sweeping down cobwebs.</p>

<speaker>Colin.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(down L.)</stage> That's more than you've done.</p>

<p> Is it—well, I shouldn't have thought so by the sound of it. Well, Alice, my

waters of the bay, as trim and as beautiful as the dear girl whose name she
bears. Servant, Master Comfort, or I should rather hail "Father," shouldn't
I?—for if all goes fair, to-day sees the splicing of Ben Bolt and his pretty

<p> If ever father gave child with the assurance and prospect of a happy future,
I do mine. I've known you, Ben, from careless infancy to manhood's riper days ;

<speaker>Ben.</speaker>
<p> Oh, sir, in giving me Alice, you freight my heart with such a cargo of
blessings that its weight seems almost to founder the hull that bears it. When
in humbleness and poverty, I worked the reckoning to gain the prize I look upon,
the thought of this moment was the bright light that drove the dark clouds of
doubt and fear far away, amidst the broken waters in my wake; and when the storm
came, and the loud tempest sent its raging waters round the devoted bark, and
pale faces with sinking hearts looked upon the doom that threatened, there came
to me a whisper of hope—a thought of Alice—and my heart grew firm as the planks
I stood on! I flew to my duty, and clinging to the quivering mast that bent like
a reed before the fierce hurricane, gathered the torn and shattered canvas until
it lay furled and snug as the babe pressed to its mother's breast, and when the
storm passed and the lull came, and the bold vessel careered on her homeward
course, every wave that broke beneath our way, foam-crested, seemed to bear upon
its glassy surface the name of her I loved.</p>

<p> Nonsense, my girl; it isn't every capful of wind capsizes a craft; stout
hearts and strong timbers weather out the roughest gale; besides, my lass, I've
given up long voyages; luck has squared the sails for me, I've made money enough
to buy a craft of my own, and yonder she floats, every timber of her as fresh
and as firm as your own heart, my dearest Alice.</p>

his log on the head of a rum puncheon—slept and kept his dog watches with his
mouth upon the vent peg, and wouldn't trade for any freight that wasn't cargoed
with rum, sugar, lemons, and hot water; he pickled his junk in rum—soaked his
biscuit in rum—rum'd his coffee—rum'd his tea—took his plum duff with rum
sauce—swore as he lived by rum, he'd die by rum, and so he did, for he was found

<p> Yes, he'd take that every day after tea, and think nothing of it-well, you
see it was scarcely daylight when we found him, and one of the crew took a light
to look in his pocket for the ship's papers, when, my eyes, the moment the
candle came alongside him, off he went over the sides in a blue flame, leaving
nothing behind him but the nails of his shoes, them I suppose the rum couldn't
touch—but what say you to a rattling dance ? Alice and I will foot it away as

<stage>Scene I.— The same Scene as First Act. The mill-wheel broken and stopped,
the Cottage much dilapidated, porch broken, and the withered roses spread about
in confusion, the whole appearance of the scene that of neglect and desolation.
— Moonlight. </stage>
<stage> As the curtain rises, from the orchestra is played a movement imitating
the hoot of the owl; an owl is seen to fly from the mill to the spire of the
church and pass behind it; a pause — and then the air of "Ben Bolt" is played. </stage>

revolves on the principle of a secret panel — he looks cautiously round and then
closes the entrance. </stage>

<speaker>Iron.</speaker>
<p> Burrowing like a rat don't suit my constitution ; I like the open air and
the bright warm sun, not prowling about like an owl in the moonlight; I've had
no luck after that affair of Bolt's. I've been a marked man ever since the
burning of the sloop—although they couldn't prove it against me, they were
satisfied in their own minds that it was done through my means, and every
neighbour and customer cut me ; the mill went to decay—not that I care much for
that, for thanks to my other profession, the loss of trade won't destroy my
worldly prospects—but I've been even with them ; and if Bolt should ever come
back from his cruisings, he'll find desolate home and a cold-hearted welcome,
and have me to thank for both. None of the village for a moment think I'm living
in the very heart of them—they give me credit for being far away; no no, I'm
among them yet, and trust to make more mischief. There's no one stirring—I'll to
the beach and plant the signal.</p>

<p> I've planted the signal, and when the moon goes down the lugger can launch

playing a safe game- another run or two and I'm a made man, and then I'll really
quit the neighbourhood, and in a distant land, under an assumed name, all
remembrance of Ironlink, the smuggling miller, will be buried in oblivion. I
wonder what this is I picked up on the beach. <stage>(takes out an old-fashioned

Is there any name? What, Ben Bolt!—ha, ha ! then he must have gone down in last
night's storm, and the waves have washed into my hands the property he has
accumulated for the benefit of his heirs. Well, I'll take care of it for'em.
This settles the business; to-night sees me off; Levi, the Jew dealer, will buy
the stock of silks and lace, now in the mill, and clear all at his own

papers of the past, to have known how all fared with my dear—dearAlice. For four
years love and fortune has smiled upon me and to lose it all at the very
harbour's mouth of home and happiness, seems the hardest knot in the tangled
hank of life's log. There's the cottage; it don't somehow look so trim and
shipshape as it did—the porch is broken—the sweet flowers that twined around it,
withered. Ah, well, the anxious heart that keeps the long-watch in grief and
sorrow grows careless of all save the point it looks and longs for. The mill
too, its roof-tree bare, its wheel broken; and all is cold and quiet as a dead
calm—well, heaven forgive me if I joy at what I look upon, its owner did me deep
wrong, and I must exult at the judgment that waits upon the evil-doer. But
avast, I feel as if an ice-bolt was coiled around my heart—desolation here—
<stage>(pointing to cottage)</stage> there—and all around. Has death boarded the

<stage>Mary is heard within to sing the following verse of "Ben Bolt." </stage>
<l>Oh, don't you remember the wood, Ben Bolt,</l>
<l>Near the green sunny slope of the hill,</l>
<l>Where oft we have sung 'neath its wide spreading shade, </l>
<l>And kept time to the click of the mill ? </l>

<l>And quiet now reigns all around;</l>
<l> See the old rustic porch, with its roses so sweet, </l>

song sinks on his knees, and gathering some of the withered roses, presses them
to his lips. </stage>

<p> Her song, but not with her voice. Oh, Alice, Alice, has the lead line of

rock of certainty, than live in a sea of gloomy doubt. <stage>( advancing to the

<l>And the running little brook is now dry ;</l>

peace and rest? If so may a seaman's prayer help to hallow the turf that covers

me; the only regret I feel is, that I am to be broken up by a lubber like that.
Heaven help me, I've no wish to beat about without compass, bolt, or stay, to
bind me to the land that once looked fair and green, when my poor Alice was the
star I steered by—now she's gone, the cable that bound me to life is every
strand of it severed. Alice, poor dear Alice, I could cry like a child, but that
my bursting heart hasn't the stowage left of a single tear!</p>
