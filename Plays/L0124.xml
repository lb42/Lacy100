   <head>THE LOAN OF A LOVER.</head>

   <stage type="setting"> Scene — Gardens of a Villa on the Canal, near Utrecht. The tower of the
    Cathedral is seen in the distance. In E. corner of the Garden, overlooking the Canal, is a
    Summer House, in the Dutch taste. </stage>
   <stage> Enter Swyzel and Delve, L. 2 E. </stage>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Do as you're bid, and no reflections. Don't you know the mistress is the master ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M4">
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> Well, but now really, Mynheer Swyzel—to put out the orange-trees before the white frosts are
     over—is that common sense ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> What have you to do with common sense ? Nothing at all, or you would not pretend to have
     more than your mistress. It is Mamzelle Ernestine's pleasure to turn the orangery into a
     ball-room, and turned it must be.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M4">
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> But the trees will die.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Let 'em die, then—that's their business; yours is to clear the place out, according to
     order. About it without more words! If she told me to fling all the Schiedam in the cellar into
     the canal, I should do so, without hesitation.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M4">
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> You'd fling yourself after it, I'm sure.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Not when it was mixed with water, you rogue! or while the baron has money enough to buy
     more. Come —to work! to work ! or you'll not get the-room ready by midnight.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M4">
    <speaker>Del.</speaker>
    <p> O, my poor orange trees—they'll die, every one of them! <stage>Exit Delve, L.</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Silly fellow, to trouble his head about what does not concern him. If his employers take no
     care for their own interests, why should he fidget about them ? He hasn't the slightest notion
     of service ! Ah ! here's Peter Swyk.</p>
    <pb n="4"/>
    <stage> Enter Peter, R.</stage>
    <p>Well, Peter.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Good morning, Master Steward.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> So, you've been to Amsterdam, to buy cattle, I hear?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ay, and fine beasts they are too, Master Steward: but, talking of beasts, how do you find
     yourself to-day ? You were rather poorly when I left.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, I'm better, thank you; but I'm not so young as I was thirty years ago—I find that,
     Peter. Ah ! I envy you, you rogue ! Three-and-twenty—stout-timbered— light-hearted—and rich, I
     may say; for old Jan Spyk, your father, left you a pretty round sum, I take it ?' </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why, it might have been less, and yet worth having, Master Steward.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, and why don't you get a wife now ? All the girls in the neighbourhood are pulling caps
     for you !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why, I don't know; they do look at me, somehow, but I'm not smitten with anybody in
     particular. However, I don't wish to prevent them—they may fall in love with me, then I can
     choose, you know.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, perhaps that's the best way.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, I think so ; as Gertrude said to me, the other day, you don't love anybody in
     particular, Peter, so you can look about you.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Gertrude—what, our Gertrude ? The simpleton that has the run of the house and gardens, by
     permission of the baron, because she is the orphan daughter of his old bailiff, and who is
     always so mighty busy, doing nothing at all, by way of earning the living allowed her! Is she
     your counsellor ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, she and I gossip now and then, when we meet. She's a sort of relation of mine—my
     brother-inlaw's aunt stood godmother to her.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, that is a sort of relation, certainly.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And then, you see, simpleton as she is, she has now and then an idea, and that's the only
     thing I want—I never have an idea. It's very odd, but I never have what you can really call an
     idea—of my own, that is—for I'm quick enough if a person only just—and yesterday, now, I saw
     her but for two or three minutes, and I'll be hanged
     <pb n="5"/>if she didn't give me a capital idea! and that's what has brought me here this
     morning. You've a captain Amersfort staying here, haven't you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, yes ; one of our young lady's score of lovers and the best of 'em, too, to my mind; but
     she's too capricious to make up hers. He's a fine fellow—handsome, clever, gallant—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And landlord of the fine farm of Appledoorn— so Gertrude says.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Ah! and you want to be his tenant, no doubt ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Why Gertrude thinks—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, she's right there—it's a pretty property; but there are several farmers offering.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> So she tells me ; but she says that if you were to speak to the captain in my favour—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Well, she's right there, too. If I were to speak—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> And will you ?—will you, Master Steward ? I've a keg at home of the finest flavour, which I
     should be too happy—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M3">
    <speaker>Swy.</speaker>
    <p> Pshaw ! pshaw ! you know if I do anything it's never with a view to benefit myself, Peter;
     so send me the keg, if it will serve you, and we'll see what can be done about it.</p>

    <p>
     <stage>(aside)</stage> An old rogue, I'm sure he is; and he always snubs me and scolds me. So
     does everybody, indeed, except Peter. Peter never snubs me, at any rate; but that's because he
     hardly ever speaks to me. Now only look at him at this moment! there he stands, puffing away
     with his pipe, and turning up the whites of his eyes, Now, what can he be thinking about ?—that
     is if he is thinking. Suppose it's about—<stage>( aloud, and taking hold of his arm)</stage>
     —Peter!</p>

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Thinking about ? Why, I was thinking about Mother Wynk's tavern, where I breakfasted this
     morning.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> What an interesting subject!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Rather. The old vrow worried my life out with "Why don't you get married, farmer Spyk?"—"Why
     do you live alone in that old house, like an owl in an ivybush ?—"Why don't you take a wife ?
     You've got money enough to keep one, and you are your own master : you've only to please
     yourself."</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Well, and haven't I told you so over and over again ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well, so you have; and I do think if I should get the Appeldoorn Farm, I'll sign a lease and
     a contract the same day.</p>
    <pb n="7"/>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> But, if you don't get the farm, what does it signify ?—you might marry all the same for
     that. You've enough without. You needn't wait—that is, if you like anybody well enough to marry
     them.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, but then I don't know that I do. Now, who is there, in your opinion, that would suit
     me.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, don't know. I dare say, if I were to choose, I could name somebody.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Well, but let's see now. To begin with the neighbourhood:—I know all the girls here, and I
     am sure I can't say— <stage>(suddenly)</stage> —What d'ye think of Mary Moerdyke, to begin
     with?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Very bad, to begin with, and much better to have done with as soon as possible. She is the
     worst tempered girl in all Utrecht, and as tall as the tower yonder—a great, gawky, sulky
     thing, just like it.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, well, I don't think she would suit me.— But there's her cousin, Judith—she's very
     good-natured!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, Judith's a pretty girl, if you please, and very good-natured, as you say,—perhaps a
     little too good- natured.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
    <speaker>Pet.</speaker>
    <p> No, really—humph !—I shouldn't like that. What d'ye say to Anne Stein ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_F5">
    <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
    <p> Everybody says she's a great coquette. See her on a Sunday, that's all! or at a dance at the
     fair! She's always changing her partner.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0124_M2">
