<head>SCENE I. </head>
<stage>—Gun platform of the parade of Elizabeth Castle; time, early in the
morning. Sentinels are pacing up and down; the moon shines brightly. The left
hand of perspective shows the Island of Jersey and Tower of St. Helier's, the
clock of which is heard to strike three.</stage>

men: he has seen much service, and is brave to a fault.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>I wish he was a coward to a fault, he'd run away from mine, perhaps. But what
an old gig it is!—with a face like a leg of pork after an hour's roasting, a
head as frosty as Mount St. Bernard, and a tail like a roasting pig!—he can't
speak without giving the word of command, and his “Attention” may be heard all
over the castle. I tell you, Serjeant Brill, that old daddy Bland is—</p>

<p>Ready, lads; salute the old gentleman as the commanding officer wishes.</p>
<stage>Enter Lieutenant Bland, R. 1 E., dressed in military uniform; the blue
coat almost green, the lace and epaulettes very much tarnished; boots and
breeches as the Corporal describes; his accoutrements in very good order; he
wears a pigtail, and his whole appearance that of a comic Frederick the
Great.</stage>

<p>Keep awake, of course: no good soldier goes to bed above once a week. In
fact, I don't know that a soldier has any business to sleep at all; and if he
does, it should be like   geese, on one leg, with his chin on the muzzle of his
musket.</p>

<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p> Come along, Charles; the major's party have not seen us yet. All's right,
and now I defy the devil and— <stage>(sees Bland)</stage> —old daddy Bland, by
all that's terrible!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p> Why name the devil and our worthy artillery senior in the same breath, eh?

you well— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Or at the devil, eh? Yes, gentlemen, old daddy Bland is here; and now I ask,
with all due respect to the Fifty-eighth and Rifle Corps, what the devil you do
here, gentlemen?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, my friend Charles and myself, we have been at our military studies
all night—storming forts—taking them —attacking in column—taking possession of
the breastworks— forcing a breach—plundering the town—and retreating with our
brows bound with laurel.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What! retreating, and our brows bound with laurel! Why who the devil heard of
laurels gained in a retreat?</p>

Moore.</p>

<p>Eh? Oh, yes—oh, yes; Sir John Moore, yes. Stop, let me take off my hat.

<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>All right, Charles.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Let me tell you, gentlemen, that Sir John Moore didn't go gallanting of a
night, in despite of garrison orders, as you do. So don't think I'm to be
palavered over. No, no; I never, gentlemen, was guilty of a breach of discipline
in my life, and I am now seventy-five.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>What, Mr. Bland?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">

<p>
<stage> (with affected surprise.)</stage> What, seventy-five? </p>
<pb n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, Charles, what did you suppose the lieutenant's age?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>   Fifty-three I should have sworn in any company in Europe.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Really! Why you are certainly nearer to the truth than me. I put Mr. Bland
down at six-and-forty, and, in fact, told Lady Mary Meriville so last week; and
she said she had no idea, from his appearance, that he had been anything near so
old.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Did she though, eh? Ha, ha, ha! Well, I don't know. I was born in the
Artillery Corps, and regimental books are frequently lost, and I never was
registered otherwise; but I—I—might not be so old.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>You can't, my dear sir; it don't stand to reason!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Let anybody look at Mr. Bland this morning!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Why, yes, boys, I think this is one of my good-looking days. Go on,
gentlemen, go on.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Come, Charles; the lieutenant says we are to go on. Come to our rooms.
<stage>(crosses, R. H.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (stopping them.)</stage> No, no, gentlemen; if you please, you will give
an account of your unsoldierlike conduct. How will you like to see yourselves
superseded, gentlemen, eh?— perhaps broke, eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>My dear sir, I—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Really, upon my word, Charles, you are unpardonable. Had you brought the book
with you, it would have cleared us in Mr. Bland's opinion, which, I may truly
say, I value more   than any man's in the service.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What book, eh? what book?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>What the devil is he at now? <stage>(aside.)</stage>
</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, a book I had been anxiously waiting for during the whole night—a history
of the taking of Montreal, wherein the names of Lieutenant Bland and the
Engineers are made such honourable mention of—Charles and I pored over it with
delight—with enthusiasm—the just tribute of a grateful country to a venerated
friend so gallant and true. <stage>(they bow to Bland.)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Gentlemen— <stage>(bows.)</stage> —I certainly endeavoured to do my duty. I
was quite a youngster then, and I—he, he, he!— I didn't know that it had been
taken such notice of. Will you favour me with the book for a few moments? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M2">
<speaker>Edge.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (aside.)</stage> How the devil will he get out of it now?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M1">
<speaker>Gay.</speaker>
<p>Why, Mr. Bland, I gave it to the lieutenant here to bring. He forgot it, and
I was bewailing my disappointment when we had the honour of meeting you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p> Well, well; but don't stay out again. Go to your <pb n="7"/> rooms—
<stage>(crossing, R.)</stage> —but, eh, stop; your stomachs are raw this
morning. In my room, in the left cupboard, you'll find some cherry brandy.
Lieutenant Edgecombe, by the commandant's order, I appoint you to the Grand
Round to-night. Away, gentlemen. Bastion Twenty-four, fire the morning salute
gun. <stage>(goes round, giving orders; gun fires without.)</stage>

<p>Well, now, really, as I am a gentlewoman and mother of a good girl, I must
put an end to the visits of that young English officer. I begin to repent that I
ever allowed him a footing here. My nephew will be home from England soon, and
I'll ask his advice upon the subject; but for this Lieutenant Edgecombe—</p>

<p>I'll tell you, child: you may fall in love with him, and he with you. Never
fall in love with a nice young man; it's ruin, either one way or the other. Your

let a wife find she is a wife. You marry as ugly a man as you can meet with!</p>

<p> I am much obliged to you, but I'd much rather not; and I believe that most

affectation.</p>

<p>Your uncle was a sort of elegant Æsop—a large head, small body, little legs,

his murder—public curiosity was excited—the “Halfpenny Humbug” sold

Stickers, take care of yourself;” and bless your soul, when I got up to London

<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>This is a very shocking affair, but I can't believe it. I sent Edgecombe to
La Roque Tower this morning, deputing Lacy, in his room, at the castle.
Ma'mselle Marie must have been mistaken. I've sent off a dozen dragoons in
several directions. Blood near the spot, but no visible marks of a struggle! It
can't be. A man never went out of the world without a struggle.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>No, I am sure I've had a struggle all my lifetime, and I am only a poor
corporal, five feet wanting an inch, and I mustn't expect to get any higher.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Don't prate, fellow; you may go into that tavern.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>Thank your honour. Shall I order anything for you at the same time?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Scoundrel! you know I never take anything. My only beverage is vinegar and
water—the best drink in the world for a soldier!</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>Ah, a poor fellow like me can't afford the best, so I put up with humble gin
and water—it suits my constitution very well.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Varlet! you have been allowed liberty of tongue till you forget yourself.
Attention! Go and ask if they have seen Mr. Edgecombe to-day. He calls here
sometimes for intelligence from Weymouth.</p>

<sp who="#L0378_M7">

<p>Here, in the very nick, comes Betty Broom, the   chambermaid—the Mrs. Flowers

<p>Pshaw!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>When we are on the march, she will be the flower of the baggage waggon. I am
going to be made the regimental schoolmaster, and she will get the company's
washing; so that, between learning and lathering, we will make something out,
and I hope there will be soon a number of little Flowers beautifully blooming
around us.</p>

<p>Betty, my love, a gentleman has been murdered on the South Cliff; have you
seen him pass this way since?</p>

<stage> (R.)</stage> What an ass the fellow is!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_F12">
<speaker>Betty.</speaker>
<p>Oh dear, no, Mr. Flowers. If I had seen a dead man walking about here, I
should have flopped off in a fit directly; you don't know how tender-hearted I
am! Oh, my little stars! Murdered? I could tell you something!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What the devil is it? Don't stand pouting there, but out with it.</p>

<p>Well, then, as I am a virtuous young woman standing here, there's a murderer
in our house!</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>It thickens, as the woman said when she put oatmeal into the porridge.</p>

<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Where is this man?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_F12">
<speaker>Betty.</speaker>
<p>Up stairs in a room by himself; he's so mysterious, and won't see anybody,
and eats and drinks such a sight! Oh, how he does eat and drink!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M7">
<speaker>Flowers.</speaker>
<p>Right. He thinks his time is short, so he will make the most of it.</p>

<p>Yes, your honour. Left face! Betty, lead the van.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_F12">

<speaker>Stick.</speaker>
<p>
<stage> (without, R. C.)</stage> It's all over with me; the murder's out! I beg,

<p>What could prompt you to this horrid deed?</p>
</sp>

<p>My poverty, but not my will, consented.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">

<p>What! you robbed him first, I suppose, then—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">
<speaker>Stick.</speaker>
<p>That was no use; he never had more than five farthings in his pocket at any
time—just the price of half a pint.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">

murder?</p>

<p>Where?</p>
</sp>

<p>In the blacksmith's shop.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">

<p>Let it be searched. Tell me, villain, how was it contrived—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

kill him!</p>

<p>Fun! you infernal rascal?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>Only for a week, that was all!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Who the devil ever heard of a man being killed for a week? And did you do
this in cold blood?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">
<speaker>Stick.</speaker>
<p> No, we got rather warm over it, cause Jack Nokes wanted to kill him with a
knife, and I would have him knocked on the head!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>My flesh crawls to hear the villain! Well—</p>
</sp>
<pb n="17"/>

<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>So we made him get very drunk at a pothouse near town.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Drunk at a pothouse, instead of being on his guard!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">
<speaker>Stick.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but a man's off his guard when he gets drunk. Then we got him into a
green lane, and threw him into a ditch, and smothered him; and he was found next
morning by a pedlar.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What the devil am I to make of this?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>I don't know; we made a good deal of it; we sold a good many—</p>
</sp>

<p>Bodies, I suppose he means. <stage>(aside.)</stage> You've carried on this
horrid business some time, then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>About eight months. Great pity we were stopped; we had two or three subjects
ready.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">

<p>Subjects! Yes, that's the name surgeons give them. What did you get for
them?</p>

<p>A ha'penny apiece.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">
<speaker>Stick.</speaker>
<p>A ha'penny! and a liberal allowance to those who took a good many.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Well, of all the horrid villains I ever met in my life,   or heard of, you
are the worst. You murder your fellow-creatures at a halfpenny apiece! What do
you call such an affair?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>Humbug!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M3">
<speaker>Bland.</speaker>
<p>Why, you infernal—I'll—I'll—you shall swing in two hours from this. Confine
that rascal immediately, and put him into irons. He shall be soon taken to
Gallows Hill.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0378_M5">

<p>No, I hate them all, and the body-snatchers. Away with him!</p>

<p>Why the plague don't Edgecombe arrive? Here have I wasted these three hours
waiting for him. Capital plan <pb n="18"/> I had formed, to have persuaded him
to take a little more champagne, then to have rode off for the castle, pleaded
illness on his behalf, offered myself as the officer of the watch, and so have
won my wager with the pretty Marie. I live for fun. Never was sad, sick, or
sorry in my life. Why the devil don't he come? Holloa! what's this? A

lead up to the aperture; part of which is discernible to the Audience. On L. H.
a low grated door, apparently belonging to a dungeon; at the back is seen
several entrances to interior caverns; along the upper part, and over the
entrance to the back caves is a rude gallery in the rock—a very huge
oak-fashioned table in centre of stage, with benches, horns and implements about
here and there—a gun, &amp;c.</stage>

the Fifty-eighth; of muskets we have plenty. Let a dozen men attire themselves
