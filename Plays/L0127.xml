      <p>But I am not inclined that he shall be my intended, while there are so many smart young men
       to look unutterable things at me, and so many handsome soldiers coming home. Do you think I
       shall make him so unhappy as to make him my <hi>worst</hi> half? Oh dear, no, Rosine! I love
       soldiers. It's the delight of my heart to look at their long swords and lovely
       mustachios!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps you would not object to my brother? He's a soldier.</p>

      <p>Not too long for my determination. To live happily, one must be—</p>

     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Oh! Marriage is like a—like a beautiful rose.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>  With plenty of thorns about it, to prick your fingers
       <pb n="4"/>occasionally. You can be cheerful—you will marry a soldier—my dashing brother,
       Victor, of the 20th regiment of cavalry;—while poor <hi>I</hi>, am condemned to your cousin
       Cocklet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>But fools don't always make the worst husbands.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>But you were to tell me, Rosine, how it was your father allowed your brother to be brought
       up away from home, and the story of his going into the army, and all that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>As I know you can keep a secret, I'll tell you one;—he is but my half-brother.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Oh! Well?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>When my father was a young man he fell in love with a very beautiful creature, as you or I
       may be. His father desired him to marry another; and, as he had not courage to disobey his
       parent, nor the heart to forget his beautiful creature, he was placed in a very awkward
       situation.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Very!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>However, he at last married my mother, and the poor beautiful creature, took it so much to
       heart, she would'nt shew herself to anybody; till at length, people said, they heard strange
       noises in the cottage, where the beautiful creature lived, like somebody hushing a baby. The
       fact is, I had a brother, who was brought up about twenty miles from hence, by a person, of
       the name of Jacquard, a farmer, at Merival, with whom he lived for sixteen years, when he
       quarrell'd with the farmer's son, and the farmer turned my brother   out of doors.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And without letting him know who he was?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>How could he?—he was ignorant of it himself. At length, my mother died, and then, father
       ventured to enquire about him, when he learnt that he had enlisted in a regiment that was on
       its march to Poland.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And if the report that he has fallen should turn out to be a false one, how would any of
       you be able to know him again, if he ever should return?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>The farmer knew the regiment he had enlisted in, and when my father explained the secret,
       he sent him a certificate detailing all the circumstances of his birth;—so it will not be
       difficult to recognise him when he produces that.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>And why, until this moment, have you always kept this affair a secret?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>Because I am so discreet.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>
      <p>Indeed?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0127_F8">
      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>To be candid with you, I never knew it myself till last night.</p>

     <sp who="#L0127_F9">
      <speaker>Nin.</speaker>

      <speaker>Ros.</speaker>
      <p>My father and your father were locked up together in our green parlour. To that room is a
       door, to that door, there is a key-hole, and to that key-hole was an ear. (You could'nt.) I
       felt so interested—Hush! Your father.<stage>Enter Gavard from inn.</stage></p>

      <p>Nonsense! It's a guard will soon weary you. Come, there's a time for all things—for love,

       imposter! My knapsack has been changed, but when or how, I'm at a loss to guess. I should
