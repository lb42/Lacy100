    <p>Why, when master and missus went away this morning, they said they were going on a visit, and

    <p>For my brother Frank?</p>

    <p>Yes, here it is. <stage>(drawing a letter from his pocket)</stage> I have been ordered to

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>And so you are Master Harry, eh? You are the favourite, you are.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>How did you learn that?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Godfather has made me acquainted with all the family matters, for I am quite fresh, I am.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>You are quite fresh! what do you mean?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>I mean I was quite new this morning. Godfather brought me here and showed me to your
     grandmother just as she was stepping into the old family coach; she had only just time to say,
     “Oh! this is the stupid animal you have told me about.” You see, she is so old that she doesn’t
     always know what she is talking about.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>I think, though, her faculties were pretty clear this morning. But, as you say, she is rather
     old—eighty-two. Considerably wrinkled, I should think.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Her face is just like a little apple that has been dried in the sun.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>And my grandfather?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>He is like a little pear that has been baked in an oven.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>I am certain I should not recognize them; they must be very dull here, all by themselves.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>Godfather says that they sometimes yawn till they get a lock-jaw; that’s why they have just
     advertised in the papers for somebody to read to them.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>Read to them!</p>
   </sp>

    <p>Well?</p>

   <sp who="#L0979_M3">
    <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
    <p>I shouldn’t be able to find anything. <stage>(confidentially)</stage> Godfather says that you
     are a pet, and that your brother is a bad lot; old folks won’t have him at any price.</p>

    <p><stage>(aside)</stage> I know it but too well. <stage>(aloud)</stage> You will find some

    <p>Yes, sir.</p>

    <p>I will. <stage>(aside)</stage> He’ll help me, I can see, to redden my nose!</p>

   <stage>Exit, with portmanteau, door, L.</stage>

   <sp who="#L0979_M2">
    <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
    <p>Have I done well to present myself here under my brother’s name, because I know their great
     preference for him, and that they treat me like a Cinderella of the male sex. This is the way I
     discovered that I was no favourite; one day I wrote to them for money, and didn’t get it: while
     Harry, who had also written for some, did: then I questioned myself as to what I had done, and
     as to what I had not done. I said to myself, it is nearly twelve years since Harry and I
     quitted the old people; we are of the same figure, considerably resemble each other; I could
     easily impose upon my grandmother, who is nearly blind, and ditto upon my grandfather, who is
     quite deaf, and so I will go to them and say here is your darling Harry, and express my
     willingness to receive as much money as they choose to give me; if my brother were to write I
     should be there to suppress his letters. Wasn’t that a clever idea? not particularly honest,
     but remarkably clever; that will teach parents to have a preference, to all respectable
     grandfathers one grandson is as good as another.</p>
