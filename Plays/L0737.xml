<div type="act">
<head>Act I .</head>
<head>Scene first .</head>
<p>—The Sitting Room in Mrs. Eversleigh's Bungalow. A spacious white walled room
opening in flat to verandah by large folding French windows, furnished with
green jalousies ; between the wooden pillars of the verandah are rolled-up mats
of reeds, the floor is covered with fine matting, the chintz-covered couches and
lounging chairs are of a light construction, cane or bamboo ; drawings here and
there on the walls ; entrances to other rooms, R. and L., marked by purdahs or
curtains of stuff or cotton, disposed in broad stripes of red and white, and
kept stretched by laths passed across at intervals of about a foot; beyond the
verandah a narrow strip of garden, bright with its growth of Himalayah
rhododendrons, and shaded with clumps of deodaras and sycamore; beyond the
garden, which is supposed to occupy the plateau on which the bungalow stands,
are seen the vast ridges and profound valleys of the Himalayahs, and in the
extreme distance, the great snowy range glittering in the sky ; as the curtain
rises, the Tailor Men are seen at work in the verandah, sewing and embroidering
Eastern muslin and other Eastern materials of female wear.</p>
<p>A Khitmugar, with an Indian whisk made of a yok's tail, is brushing off the
dust and flies from the furniture ; an Ayah is receiving some finished article
of dress from one of the tailor men. Mrs. Eversleigh discovered in a lounging
chair, R. C. ; Mahlee approaches and offers flowers, R.</p>

syringa—it overpowers me.</p>

Tailor.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M7">

<p>
<stage>(coming forward salaaming, R.)</stage> Will the Mem Sahib
give orders for to-day's dinner?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">

<p>Settle it yourself, Ramdeholl, and don't persecute me.</p>

<speaker>Khan.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(producing papers)</stage> Also, there is the account for things bought
in the bazaar this month.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>What have I to do with it? Ask Major Stonihurst to look it over—You know he
always checks your account. <stage>(Khansumah salaams and retires, R.
C.)</stage> What should I do without him? Now that I am left alone in the
world—enervated by this dreadful Indian climate—I feel his delicate and
thoughtful kindness more and more every day. Ah! one of my tame griffs! and
their dilapidated leader, Captain Slack.</p>
</sp>
<stage> Enter Greenway with Slack, L. C.</stage>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>How do, Mrs. Eversleigh? <stage>(feebly)</stage> I tried to keep him away,
but he would come !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>And Mrs. Eversleigh is glad to see me—don't you see she is. I say, Mrs.
Eversleigh—the Major says we youngsters bore you; and that we musn't call
without orders.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(C.)</stage> He is very kind. You <hi>are</hi> rather troublesome at
times—you have such overpowering spirits, Mr. Greenway.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>Yes; <stage>(seated, R.)</stage> I'm rather a stunner—lucky I am, or I
couldn't stand this country—Isn't it a deuce of a climate ? Nine months vapour
bath, and three months douche alternately. Here's old Slack is regularly
breaking up.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Captain Slack does look rather exhausted.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">

<p>
<stage>(seated R. of table)</stage> If I might trespass on your hospitality,
Mrs. Eversleigh, for a peg of soda— and brandy.</p>

<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Ask for whatever you like ! <stage>(she calls)</stage> } Khansumah!</p>
<stage> Enter Khansumah, R. C.</stage>
<p>Take the Sahib's commands! <stage>(Khansumah takes orders from Slack,
apart)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>A bottle of B. B. for me ! I'm as seedy as a P. and O. fowl this morning! I
was up till gun-fire, at blind hookey. Such a wet night, and such a jolly shindy
in the bazaar, coming home from the Major's Bungalow!</p>
<stage> Exit Khansumah, R. C.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>You silly boy!—you ought to blush, instead of boasting!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Slack does the blushing, and I do the bounce! It's the division of
labour, Mrs. Eversleigh; one must divide one's labour in this infernal climate—
into the smallest pieces too. Look at the niggers !—don't it take three of 'em
to black a boot! I believe on parade days Slack has four khitmugars to his own
cheek, to get him into his uniform. <stage>(rises)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>Oh! fire away, griff—when you've had as much of Indian service as I have
——</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>And as much Bass and brandy pawnee, and peg—to say nothing of Mess
Blackstrap, Claret, and sparkling Moselle—I shall be as ricketty, perhaps, but
it will be a long time first. If it wasn't for the hills, Slack, you know you'd
tumble to pieces every hot weather.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>Is it any wonder, with this climate ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>Climate be hanged! Look at Stonihurst!— He's had eight years of Indian
service over you—half of 'em up at Lahore too; and he's as fresh as a griff; and
as hard as a hill pony.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Stonihurst! He's a wonder—mind and body! There's a constitution, Mrs.
Eversleigh, and there's a head ! To see him knock off his company's accounts,
before he got his step—it was wonderful!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>And such a performer across country! If you could only see him out
pig-sticking, Mrs. Eversleigh —</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>I've no taste for such butchery. <stage>(gets up)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>Butchery ! it's beautiful. He handles his spear as gracefully as you do your
fan; and then to see him <pb n="6"/> make twenty off the balls without a
break—that's something like billiard playing.</p>
<stage>(Khansumah appears in verandah with beer, and brandy, and soda water
bottles, on tray)</stage>
<stage> Exit Greenway, R. C.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M3">
<speaker>Green.</speaker>
<p>But here's Slack's brandy and soda, and my double Bass. We'll have it in the
verandah. I say, Mrs. Eversleigh, why am I like Lablache ? Because I'm a Basso
profondo—deep in Bass !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>I must see that griff doesn't do himself a mischief. It's astonishing how
these boys wash their wits away with that pale ale.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Give brandy pawnee its due.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M2">
<speaker>Slack.</speaker>
<p>Yes, that's very bad too; I wouldn't touch a drop if I weren't recommended to
take it medicinally.</p>
<stage> Exit Slack, R. C.</stage>
<stage> Enter Major Stonihurst, L. C., by verandah, followed by Shawl Merchant,
who waits aside; he exchanges a salute with Slack and Greenway.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(L.)</stage> Ah, my dear Clara!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(R.)</stage> Good morning, Edward ! always apropos. Here are that
troublesome Khansumah's accounts for you to look over.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>Too happy! those fellows would eat you up alive, unprotected female as you
are, if you were left to fight them single-handed. But you will be out of your
mourning soon. I've brought up Dherah Singh, the Cashmere shawl merchant.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(with great animation)</stage> The shawl merchant ! Oh, delightful! after
wearing nothing but greys and violets these six months, to revel in colour once
more.</p>
<stage>(while she speaks, Shawl Merchants have opened their bales, and
surrounded Mrs. Eversleigh with the contents, displaying them on the furniture,
&amp;c. </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Oh ! what a lovely turquoise ! and what gorgeous green and gold! and this
crimson ! I'm completely puzzled—an <hi>embarras de richesses.</hi>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>You must take all three. The turquoise when you mean to melt, the green when
you intend to awaken hope, and the crimson when you are resolved to subdue.</p>

<p>Yes ; but I don't think I shall go—I'm scarcely out of my mourning yet.</p>

<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>That might be a reason at home; but we are not so straitlaced in India, you

<p>Well, if you'll decide upon my dress —</p>

<p>Hush ! it's still too soon for that—</p>

<p>No ! I have just drawn the Major of a couple of ponies, half forfeit on a

<p>I believe it's as good as settled. The Commissioner left her very well off,
you know. And then I hear at the Club from some of the fellows in his old

in old Eversleigh's time, before the Major joined our's.</p>

<p>Either of the girls might do worse. Greenway will come into a fine

deal of sowing. This is a heavy crop he has just told me of. So! Stonihurst is
at his old tricks. He's the black sheep of the regiment, and such a clever
unscrupulous fellow too! He bewitches the youngsters. They adore him while he
devours them—So, he's trying to hook poor Clara into the bargain. Hem—I've not

<p>Yes; we ought to have learnt to wear our masks by this time. And after all,
why look back with pain on the past ? It was all for the best. Had our boy and

separation—I should suffer still more if I thought you were expressing your real
feelings—But I see you are speaking out of the bitterness of your heart, that

long ago.</p>

<p>Confess! my poor Slack, you've not had your proper allowance of peg this

the pigeon has been plucked; he's in the dark as to the poulterers—I'll point
out to him the scandal an inquiry will bring on the regiment, and suggest how it
may be rendered unnecessary by inducing the rooks to disgorge their plunder.</p>

<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>Bravo, Mrs. Colonel Mac; I must admit you play your game well. Nothing like
buying up a traitor. Luckily I have discovered the purchase in time. I must
return the I.O.U.'s; but, then, how to raise the thousand pounds I want for the
Meerut settling ? If I don't pay up, I shall be posted as a defaulter. Here's a
dilemma ! Cashiering on the one hand, levanting on the other—I'm between the
devil and the deep sea, with a vengeance ! Well, I've been in scrapes as bad,
<pb n="42"/>and brought a whole skin out of them. I must drive matters to an
issue with Clara. Her fortune will make everything square. This woman little
knows the absoluteness of my influence over her yielding nature. Here she comes,
now for my coup d'état !</p>

</sp>
<stage> Enter Mrs. Eversleigh, door, L . </stage>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(R.)</stage> I'm lucky, my dear Clara, in finding you alone at last. Mr.

</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>I've no quarrel with the old times; a more jealous lover might, perhaps,
object to the old friend, when he comes in the shape of a smooth-spoken lawyer;
but I'm not disposed to be jealous.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(ironically)</stage> Thank you—you are very kind. Then I may see my old
playmate now and then?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>As often as you please, after we are married. My dear Clara, I've done suit

Let us fix the day.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">

<p>Before my year's mourning has expired! Do not press it, Edward.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>Clara, if your love were like mine, you would not allow an empty form to
stand between us and happiness. I have only listened to my heart.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Are you quite sure of that ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, Clara ? Is is possible you can doubt the disinterestedness

</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">

<p>Edward, were I poor, as I am rich, would you be as eager for this marriage
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>There is suspicion in your very question. I guess who has prompted it. I
warned you against this woman; you see suspicion of me has followed her into
your house—into your heart. I have not deserved this, Clara. <stage>(turns as if
to hide emotion)</stage> But from the moment that confidence is at an end, it is

<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>Stay, Edward; do not leave me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>Clara, I am not disposed to play the tyrant, and <pb n="43"/> even if I were
disposed, I have no right. But I cannot condescend to clear myself of such
suspicions as you have hinted. It is enough for me to know their source. Either
this Tunstall is kept at a becoming distance, and that woman leaves the house,
or I never set foot in it again.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_F10">
<speaker>Mrs. E.</speaker>
<p>A generous nature should not be so quick to take offence. Whatever Mrs. Mc

</sp>
<sp who="#L0737_M1">
<speaker>Stoni.</speaker>
<p>Disprove ! Am I on trial then ? Is your new friend, Mr. Tunstall, to sit in

the case.</p>
</sp>

<p>Forgive me, Clara; make some allowance for the susceptibility of ardent

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p>Your love, Clara, is not a thing of yesterday. It dates back for years—to a
time when you were still the wife of another. It has been recorded, not in words
that can be unsaid as easily as spoken, but in written pages— pages that have
been my comfort and solace, 'till now, but which, at need, may be my weapons for
self-defence and justification.</p>
</sp>

<p>You would not use my letters against me ?</p>
</sp>

<p>And why not ? You have suspicions that dishonour <hi>me</hi> —you are giving
way to them. I have what the world calls proofs, that discredit you, and I will
use them if you will not be my wife. Do you think I will sit by in silence, to
see you become the wife of another. I will give you time to consider well. Fling
aside these doubts, and be my wife at once; or act upon them and take the
consequences of throwing Edward Stonihurst over, for John Tunstall. <stage>Exit,

<p>Then, if you will not, I will. I must place her own letters before her eyes.
I know she has ceased to love me, for she has ceased to trust. I would not have
her now, were she to crawl on her knees. But I will have her at my feet suing
for mercy, that I may have the pleasure of rejecting her prayer.</p>
