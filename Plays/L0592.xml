<stage>Scene. —A Parlour, in total disorder. Door at back—two doors, R., and one
L.—a window, with ample curtains—table, chairs, &amp;c.—on a table, L., there
stands a glass vase, containing water, and in which flowers are standing—on the
wall, various pictures are suspended.</stage>
<stage>At the rising of the curtain Angelina is discovered, sewing rings on some
curtains—Anna Maria is engaged in dusting chairs violently.</stage>

<stage>(mildly)</stage> Very true, my dear! That being the case I'll just fill

up to the top of the house.</p>

<speaker>Anna.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(aside)</stage> There she goes again! A pretty notion! They're all going
to live up in the garret—just to make every farthing they can by letting the
rest o' the house! Mean-spirited, covetous creatures!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
<p>Well, I must say, Mr. Spriggins, it's excessively disagreeable, for a lady
like myself, remotely connected with the noble family of the Fitz-Pentonvilles
to leave my comfortable apartments, and live up in a wretched attic !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F5">
<speaker>Angel.</speaker>
<p> And to be condemned to dress in a dark little closet, no bigger than a
cupboard.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F7">
<speaker>Anna.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(at door)</stage> And to have to sleep in a willanous back kitchen—all
among the nasty rats and black beetles. It's a shame, it is! <stage>Exit, c.
door to l.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to Angelina)</stage> And all to gratify your papa's absurd propensity
for speculation.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_M3">
<speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(coming down ladder)</stage> Speculation, Mrs. Spriggins— and a very
promising speculation it is, too! Here's the bathing season coming on—a
tremendous influx of visitors arriving—no <pb n="5"/>end of distinguished
foreigners expected! Why, bless your heart, lodgings will be at a premium !—so
I'm determined to make hay while the sun shines—and sublet every square inch of
deal board we can possibly dispense with ! I'll wager we shall reap a golden
harvest. And I tell you what, Mrs. Spriggins, to compensate for any little
incovenience you may have to put up with, I intend to take you and Angelina up
to town, and treat you to the—<stage>(hesitating)</stage> a—a—to the British
Museum and National Gallery.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F5">
<speaker>Angel.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(pensively)</stage> I'd much sooner you'd take us to Paris, Pa.
<stage>(sighing)</stage> Heigh ho!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F4">
<speaker>Mrs. S.</speaker>
<p>There she is again with her Paris! Ever since we allowed her to spend a month
with her aunt in Paris, she has thought of nothing else.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F5">
<speaker>Angel.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(somewhat confused)</stage> The curtains are quite ready now, pa.
<stage>(lays them on sofa)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_M3">
<speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
<p> That's right, my dear,—now arrange the flower pots so as to impart an air of
botanical elegance to the apartment. <stage>(Angelina arranges flower pots,
&amp;c.)</stage> By the bye, my dear, <stage>(to his wife, producing book from
his pocket)</stage> now that we've a moment to spare, you may as well hear me my
French lesson.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_F5">
<speaker>Angel.</speaker>
<p> French, indeed! the idea of a man at your time of life beginning to learn
French !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0592_M3">
<speaker>Sprig.</speaker>
<p> How very blind some females are to be sure—don't you perceive, Mrs.
Spriggins, that I'm laying myself out to catch lodgers among foreigners of
distinction, people who hardly know the difference between a franc and a
sovereign, and who, therefore, will agree to pay whatever I think proper to ask
them. Are you not aware, madam, that I've got "Lodgings to Let" "Ici on Parle
Francais," in large type, stuck in my parlour window. I am, therefore, preparing
myself for emergencies, by studying that politest of languages, on a remarkably
expeditious system, entitled, "French before Breakfast," a system which renders
the aid of a master totally superfluous, and enables the student to speak with
Parisian purity, in rather less than no time. You'd be astonished at the
progress I have made already! <stage>(with an atrociously bad
pronunciation)</stage>
<hi>"Bongjore mounseer; commong vouz portez vous, a-a-donnez moi du pain, passez
moi la moutarde." </hi><stage>(exultingly)</stage> By Jove ! they'll be
enraptured on hearing their native tongue spoken with such extraordinary
fluency, and I shall double their rent in consequence. <stage>(bell rings at
c.)</stage> Bless my soul, there's a ring! I dare say it's somebody to look at
the apartments. Dear, dear! here's a confusion!—quick, quick ! put <pb n="6"/>these chairs in order. <stage>(great bustle and running about)</stage>
Angelina, make your escape with this work basket—run!</p>
<stage>Exit Angelina, R. 1 E., with basket.</stage>

<p> Having got tired of Zulu Kaffirs, and wild beast hunts, I sold out, returned
to England, and in an unguarded moment, recently married a lovely young lady—the
daughter of a brother officer.</p>

<p> Well, sir, wishing to give my wife a treat, I resolved upon spending a month
with her at the sea-side; we started this morning per express: in the same
carriage was a young fellow, one of those infernal, insinuating, foreign-looking
dogs! On reaching the refreshment station, my wife complains of hunger—I rush
from the train, and purchase three bath buns; no sooner had my wife tasted one
of them, than she informs me she's thirsty.</p>

Well, sir, forgetting that the ten minutes had already expired, I return to the
refreshment room, and was just compounding for a glass of sherry and water,
when—zum! zum! zum! off goes the train, with my wife and the young Frenchman
!</p>
