     Lake in the distance; the lower windows of the castle (L.) are lighted up; the

    <stage>Mrs. Fitzosborne and Jessie discovered in dinner dress, with “gauze clouds.”</stage>

     <speaker>Mrs. Fitzosborne.</speaker>
     <p>Dear me, what a while those men waste over their wine!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Do you know, I often wonder what they talk about.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! my dear, we had better not attempt to penetrate <emph>that</emph> mystery. Depend upon
      it, their conversation is not half as instructive as ours.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p><emph>We</emph> generally talk about dress.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>So do they – perhaps!</p>

     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>And horses, I daresay.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; the women that wear the dresses, and the women that break the horses.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>I daresay they are pulling us to pieces at this moment. I wish it was lady-like to listen!
      Why do ladies always retire after dinner, and leave the gentlemen alone?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>My dear, during dinner many elevating and ennobling reflections occur to them, that we
      shouldn’t understand, so we mercifully leave them that they may give utterance to their
      magnificent conceptions, or their teeming brains would burst.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Would Baby Boodle’s teeming brain burst?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>No, Baby Boodle’s brain has plenty of turning room. Whenever he shakes his head, I always
      expect to hear it rattle!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>How can you speak like that of a man you like?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Do you remember how you snubbed Guy at dinner?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, I did it on purpose.</p>

    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>How can you speak like that <emph>to</emph> a man you like? And that man going abroad
      to-night!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>That’s a very different thing. I love Guy very much, but he must be kept in order. Besides,
      you snub Baby Boodle!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, but Baby Boodle don’t know it. That’s Baby Boodle’s principal charm.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>But Baby Boodle is in love with you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sighing).</stage> Yes, he would be. These heavy vacuous, good-natured, gentlemanly
      dragoons always are. I don’t think I ever completely captivated a really clever man in my
      life. They all seem afraid of me. Look at Mr. Kavanagh – he’s a clever, bright, shrewd fellow;
      I long to try conclusions with him, but he won’t cross swords with me.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>You’re too clever for him, dear. You pay him back in his own coin, and he don’t like it. He
      wants a rose from you, and you give him a thistle. Now that frightens clever men.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>And fascinates donkeys. Perhaps you’re right. At all events it points my moral – never snub
      a clever man, if you care two pins about him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, Mrs. Fitzosborne, when will you practise what you preach?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(rises – crosses, L.)</stage> When bishops black their own boots on Sunday. No, no,
      if you want to worry poor Guy, there are other ways of doing it.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>By flirting, for instance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(L. C.)</stage> Yes, by flirting, in moderation.</p>

    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(sits on stool, R. C.).</stage> Do you know, between ourselves, I often think that
      with all my demureness, I have a hidden, secret, undeveloped tendency to flirt.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>
      <stage>(sits, C.).</stage> Do you, indeed? My dear Jessie, in a quiet demure self-contained
      way, you’re about the most irrepressible little flirt I know.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, Mrs. Fitzosborne!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Look at Denis Grant, for instance.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p>Oh, I never flirted with Mr. Grant! During the week that he has been in England I have seen
      a great deal of his society, and I like him immensely – he’s such a brave, rough, rugged,
      manly man – but flirt! why he was Guy’s schoolfellow, and his very dearest friend! Oh, Mrs.
      Fitzosborne! flirt with Mr. Grant!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, remember, Jessie, you are the first white woman he has seen for six years. Be merciful,
      dear. <stage>(rise.)</stage>
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F8">
     <speaker>Jessie.</speaker>
     <p><stage>(rise).</stage> Merciful! How ridiculous! Why, I’ve only chatted and laughed with him
      as I’ve done with fifty <pb n="5"/>others, and you’ve thought nothing of it. The idea of your
      moralizing on the subject of flirtation! Is it because you’ve never done such a thing
      yourself? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>No, Jessie. it’s because I’ve done so much of it. I’m an old hand, and I can tell in
      half-an-hour how much a man can hear. When I embark on a flirtation I do so with my fingers on
      his pulse, and I stop when I find he’s had as much as is good for him. And talking of people
      who have had as much as is good for them; here come the gentlemen at last!<stage>Enter
       Kavanagh and Boodle from dining room, through glass door.</stage>Well, Mr. Kavanagh, we’ve
      been expecting you very anxiously. What have you been talking about? Miss Blake says it’s
      dress.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_M2">
     <speaker>Kavan.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, it was dress. Baby Boodle and I have been discussing a very nice point. Having regard
      to the conformation of Baby Boodle’s face and figure, ought Baby Boodle to wear a tall hat
      with a narrow brim, and a long beard, or a low hat with a broad brim, and a short beard?
      That’s the question, and we have agreed to refer it to you.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_M5">
     <speaker>Boodle.</speaker>
     <p>Nothing of the kind, Mrs. Fitz. We were talking about –</p>

    <sp who="#L1460_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. F.</speaker>
     <p>Captain Boodle has devoted about forty years’ study to the outside of his head. I think it

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1460_M2">

      appearance is a very good sign. He has an empty house to let, and he makes its exterior as
      attractive as possible in order that –</p>

      Well, <emph>then</emph> I didn’t care. The pretty little gal was an orphan all the same. But
      when I learnt that that nephew was an orphan too, my heart yearned towards him, and I said,

     <p>There, I’m better now. Druce is an ass, but it’s better to confide in an ass than in nobody.
      There she lays! <stage>(Looking out of window.)</stage> and a rare beauty she is.
       <stage>(Takes telescope.)</stage> Perhaps I may be able to twig Jessie with this.
       <stage>(Uses it.)</stage> No! There’s nobody on board except the crew. Jessie must be on
      shore. It’s a surprising thing to feel, for the first time in one’s life, that there’s a
      delightful girl – a real live delightful girl and no deception – at least none to speak of –
      saving up for you! It’s impossible to realize it now – I suppose I shall get used to it in
      time, and get to look on Jessie as a matter of course, and shan’t be fidgety whenever she’s
      out of my sight. Joe Copley, our senior major, is never so jolly as when his wife’s out of his
      sight! That’s odd; but, then he’s been married five-and-twenty years, and the novelty may have
      worn off. Oh, Jessie – Jessie, why don’t you come? Why don’t you come? Why don’t you come?</p>

     <p>That’s it. Miss Blake ain’t Miss Blake. Her father wasn’t her father. Her property ain’t her

      can’t, and he intends to marry Miss Blake if he can’t, and he can. As you’re going to marry

      under compulsion a formal and unsatisfactory apology, which the presence of ladies compels
      your rival to accept. Eventually, however, you meet your rival where there are no ladies, and

      in much better health than when we last met. Miss Blake, that person <stage>(Indicating
       Kavanagh.)</stage> proposed to me a scheme by which he might dispossess you of your property.
      In reply, I sent him a letter, repudiating him altogether. That letter he returned to me
