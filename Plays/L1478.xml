<head>THE LAST OF THE LEGENDS; Or THE BARON, THE BRIDE, AND THE BATTERY.</head>
<div type="scene">
<stage type="setting"> Scene First - The Ruins of an ancient Castle overlooking
the Rhine; ivy-grown battlements, L. c., culminating ascent from beneath; at
back smiling landscape, through which the river is seen winding away ; as the
curtain rises the following invisible Chorus is heard.</stage>
<lg>
<head>Invisible Chorus.</head>
<l>Older than all history,</l>
<l>Come from an age long, long ago!</l>
<l>We live lost in mystery,</l>
<l>And now,—we find it rather slow!</l>
</lg>
<stage>The old clock of the Castle strikes seven; on the seventh stroke,
portions of the ruins glide away, and discover in a tableau, Karl, Fritz,
Seltzerwasser, Erlinda, Wilhelm, and Others. They all rise and come down,
looking about them with considerable surprise.</stage>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>Dear me! where am I? Have I been dreaming— or dining—or what ? <stage>(looks
about him)</stage> Yes;—yet no! Is this Pilfersberg? described in the
advertisement that caught my respected father's eye, it seems but yesterday, as
"An eligible castellated country villa residence, in thorough and substantial
repair !”</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>“Containing forty-seven bed rooms, the usual offices, a machine for pouring
boiling lead upon the heads of a besieging force, and every other modern comfort
and convenience. Fixtures, including a family ghost, to be taken at a
valuation.”</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>Exactly, Seltzerwasser! But where <stage>(looking about)</stage>,
where—where's the elegant new zinc roof I had put on the top of that tower ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>The second-hand porcullis your papa picked up a <pb n="4"/> bargain at
Damascus ? and, I say, what—what has become of his summer torture chamber, all
beautifully got up, and newly furnished ? <stage>(looking at a portion of
ruin)</stage> Why, I do believe this is where it stood ! Yes, here’s the
door!—ruins, every stone of it. I don’t think the bill for the instruments is
paid yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F8">
<speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
<p>Why, it all looks as if a thousand years had passed over it!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>It does, my dear; but it is to be hoped they haven’t been sending in their
account every quarter, or they must have ruined the firm in invoices some five
hundred years ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to Erlinda)</stage> You said a thousand years ! Why, now I come to
think of it, we’ve only got this place for nine hundred and ninety-nine—the
usual term!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Then you may depend upon it, it’s run out a twelvemonth. It all comes of your
papa’s economy, wanting to save something on the stamp! Just like him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p>But who could tell he would want a renewal?. I have never come across
anything a thousand years old yet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Then you’ve never heard one of my jokes, that’s certain ! Will you have one
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p><stage>(stopping him)</stage> No, no! I feel quite depressed enough as it is!
A thousand years, then horror! What will have become of the lady of Abbeville—my
chosen love ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Most probably a leading feature in the sarcophagus department of the British
Museum. Send for a catalogue.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>Not so; but quick, saddle my black charger, and let me off to her sea-girt
castle at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Oh, that’s the secret of your annual expedition to Boulogne. I told your
weak-minded father there was more than donkey-rides and sea-bathing at the back
of your indifferent French.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>You were right. There was—listen!</p>

<stage>Karl— Song— "The Cottage by the Sea."</stage>

<p>Yes, I will away at once!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Before you’ve solved this riddle— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>Riddle! What riddle ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Well, I should call it a tidy one. Isn’t it rather confounding to find
oneself, one’s clothes, retainers, appetite, rheumatism, and all in the midst of
a property that looks— <stage>(looking round)</stage> as if it had been let
unfurnished to a hyaena on a long term. But there, I know what’s happened!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p><stage>(rushing to him)</stage> You do! Speak.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F8">
<speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
<p><stage>(same business)</stage> Oh, tell us, do !</p>
</sp>
<pb n="5"/>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(same business)</stage> Quick, Seltzer, out with it!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>It’s as clear as the sky in the roof of your dining room. We’re in a
<hi>legend!</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_Mult">
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<p><stage>(start)</stage> A legend! <stage>(Music)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Yes, in a <hi>legend!</hi> We’re <hi>part</hi> of a legend. I might say,
humbugged into a legend. I feel convinced when I regard my boots, and think how
much I should relish a ham sandwich, that I have been to sleep for a thousand
years.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_Mult">
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<p>A thousand years!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(to Karl)</stage> Yes; don’t you remember the strange Saxon Knight,
who asked your sister Bertha’s hand ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F8">
<speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
<p>Yes; and how you promised it to him, as he started for the wars! You know you
did !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p>And swore an oath that you would wait <hi>ten centuries </hi>for his return!
<stage>(all start)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>And that very night—finding that he had but two hundred a year, a mere trifle
in ready-money, and no expectations worth mentioning—had him, at the advice of
his rival, Sir Hubert de Bow — </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F8">
<speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
<p>And spite the prayers of my dear Lady Bertha — </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(mysteriously)</stage> Put into the haunted chamber— <stage>(horror of
all)</stage> from which he evidently never returned! At seven the next morning I
took him his shaving water, his helmet, and his boots!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p>And found the three-foot-six flock mattress — </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Empty! <stage>(horror of all)</stage> Your injudicious oath has taken effect!
Ten centuries <hi>have</hi> elapsed since I put the finishing polish to those
boots! But, hush! here comes the Lady Bertha; and with her her false admirer!
Silence—not a word of this to her!</p>
</sp>

<stage>Enter Lady Bertha,followed by Sir Hubert—she carries a roll of paper, and
he holds an empty stout bottle—all bow to her respectfully.</stage>

<sp who="#L1478_F7">
<speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
<p>Count Fritz, you remember that song you made about that happy night when we
wandered together by the seashore? I am melancholy—cheer me—I would hear the
dulcet strains once more!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Song—Fritz—"Sparkling Eyes."</stage>

<sp who="#L1478_M3">
<speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
<p>Oh, fair lady, forget the foreign swain, the rosy dawn, and think of me, who
for the hundred and nineteenth time offers you his heart, his hand, and his
balance at his banker’s, <stage>(offering her the stout bottle)</stage> One
smile, one look, fair Bertha, and this priceless <hi>objet d'art</hi> exquisite
in design, <pb n="6"/>and matchless in its workmanship, shall be thine,<stage>
(he holds it out)</stage></p>
</sp>

<sp who="#L1478_F7">
<speaker>Bertha.</speaker>
<p>It is indeed beautiful; but, Sir Hubert, you know I am affianced to another.
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p><stage>(looking at "bottle)</stage> Must be true Venetian! What ; grace! What
colour! Where, gallant sir knight, where did you obtain that? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M3">
<speaker>Sir H.</speaker>
<p><stage>(with a swagger)</stage> I found it in the palace of Saladin :
himself, defended by seventy Turks, through whom I cleft my path, to gain the
prize and place it at your lovely sister’s feet, <stage>(aside)</stage> Just
picked it up in the ditch outside my window, half concealed by the
<hi>debris</hi> of a lobster salad. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(admiringly)</stage> Most delicate! And see, there is some inscription
on its side. Oh, it’s a gem!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(reading)</stage> “ Double London Stout.”</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>Double London Stout ! What does that mean ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F8">
<speaker>Erlin.</speaker>
<p><stage>(rapturously)</stage> Perhaps the true elixir of life !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(taking bottle)</stage> I shouldn’t wonder. It tastes uncommon like
it. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F7">
<speaker>Bertha.</speaker>
<p><stage>(unfolding a large poster on which is written legibly “Daily
Telegraph, largest circulation in the world. Price one penny.”)</stage> And what
does <hi>this</hi> mean? I found it ; affixed to my bedchamber wall in the
castle.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M5">
<speaker>Wilhelm.</speaker>
<p>Some fearless knight—and that <stage>(points to poster)</stage>must be his
<hi>standard.</hi></p>
</sp>


<sp who="#L1478_M6">
<speaker>Seltz.</speaker>
<p>Standard! No, that’s his «Telegraph!”<stage>(reads)</stage> "Largest
circulation in the world!” Oh, I give it up; he must be "on the confines of the
boundless desert,” or at some fearful spot beyond the reach of human
“correspondence.” But wait! This will decide. If I have topped Methuselah and
the fair lady Bertha is a charming creature of a thousand and nineteen summers,
possibly we shall find some trifling change below, <stage> (points to
scene)</stage> My youthful but patriarchal master, hear your doom. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M1">
<speaker>Karl.</speaker>
<p>At once! <stage>(approaches battlements and suddenly starts)</stage> Ha! what
do I see? A mighty city on the site of my wild boar forest!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M2">
<speaker>Fritz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(looking)</stage> And the castle of the terrible Baron of Hapenstein,
neatly laid out in gravel paths and garden seats, and - </p>

<p>Labelled with a notice that "The band plays from four to six,” and is

</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_F7">
<speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
<p>So she does ! Wonderful ! But look in the high road beneath. A beautiful

and thirteen out. Oh, it is exquisite! What luxury! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1478_M6">
