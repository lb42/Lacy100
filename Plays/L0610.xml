so, on second thoughts, I forbid the conversation. Well, don't pout! and you
shall talk of it—but not until you have finished my portrait! Now, this is

    <p>That's what uncle Templeton said. He wrote to tell me that my wicked husband
was making love to some horrid vile coquette, whose name he had not learned.
“Had you been a coquette yourself,” he added, “you might have entered the
field against this woman; but you know nothing of the art—the more's the
pity—for it ought to form a notable part of a girl's education.”</p>

    <p>His words gave me a new idea, a very extravagant one, I fear. I thought if
