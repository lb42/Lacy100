    <p>The two little Dramas of <title>A Rough Diamond</title> and <title>Good for Nothing</title>,
     would not have been published but for the loss to the English Stage of one of its greatest
     ornaments,—the original representative of Margery and Nan. Whatever of goodness of heart,
     affection, cheerfulness, honesty, and self-sacrifice may be found in those characters, the
     truthfulness with which she pourtrayed such qualities may be mainly ascribed to the fact, that
     they existed in her own genuine and most genial nature.</p>

    <p>It was intended by the Author to keep these with other productions unpublished, and solely
     for the professional use of the late Mrs. Fitzwilliam; but the affliction he has suffered in
     losing one so dear to him having changed this intention, and prevented him ever again appearing
     as Cousin Joe or Tom Dibbles, he has been induced to print the Dramas in the hope that the
     female characters may be found suited to young and rising talent, of which the Stage at the
     present time unfortunately stands so much in need.</p>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I thought it was a face I knew. I’m very glad to see you—it’s more than two years since we

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> My regiment is quartered about a mile off—we arrived there but yesterday—I knew you had a
     country house in the neighbourhood, and I had come in search of you.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Excellent! now I have indeed a companion, for I shall expect you to pass all your leisure
     with me. I thought you were abroad, as I had not heard from you so long.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I have been stationed in Ireland.</p>

    <p> You’re looking in excellent health, and your spirits are as buoyant as ever, I’m sure.</p>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I have nothing to complain of as regards my health—my spirits I can’t say much for.</p>

    <p> No, I’ve nothing to fear from them.</p>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Some love affair—some tender attachment.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Now you’re right; I may as well be candid and tell you so.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Jilted, or rejected, or——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Shortly after you left me at college, I formed an attachment to a young girl that I idolized
     with all the enthusiasm of youth.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Aye, aye; we generally begin that way.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> My passion was returned with equal fervor; when it became necessary that I should select my
     position in life. My friends suggested the army, and my inclination led me to adopt their
     views. Ireland soon became my destination—a constant correspondence with the object of my
     passion was my only solace in exile, and for months I almost daily opened a letter written by
     her dear hand.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> How delightful! I have often thought how charming it must be to receive an eloquent letter
     from a much-loved source—to have the colloquial grace of a Sévigné mingled with the fervor of a
     Heloise, or the moral delicacy of a Chapone. Oh, my dear fellow, I envy you!</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Have you never experienced that happiness?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Never;—but proceed with your history, mine shall follow—you went to Ireland, and there
     received letters from the lady of your love.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> A long silence ensued.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What anxious hours you must have passed.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Till one morning my servant placed a letter on my table—the object of my passion had married
     during her silence.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I guessed as much—always something ominous in a woman’s silence.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Her parents had met with misfortunes—a wealthy match presented itself—a match with a
     title.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> A match with a title!—ignition at once, of course.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> The temptation, added to the prayers of her friends, were too much for her. She yielded, but
     assured me she had done so with a broken heart—implored me to forget her—that her lot in life
     was cast, that the stern duties of her future existence should be fulfilled if she died in the
     struggle, yet confessed that I still occupied one little
     <pb n="7"/> corner in her heart, and concluded with a beautiful quotation from Milton.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> A refined mind, an educated divinity, no doubt—one formed to adorn the rank she had
     gained.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> She was indeed accomplished.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I thought so. Spoke Italian, no doubt?</p>
   </sp>

    <p> Fluently.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">

    <p> And French?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">

    <p> Better than a native.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">

    <p> What a woman! Understood music?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">

    <p> An enthusiast in the science.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">

    <p> Yes.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">

    <p> Yes, and chaos, and everything.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What a woman! I should have adored her. And you lost this professor in petticoats?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Irrevocably! She concealed the name and title of her husband, as she did not wish me to
     write in reply, as any reproach from me would but add to her wretchedness—and now you know the
     cause of my dejection.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I pity you from my heart. If you have <emph>lost</emph> a treasure, you should see the one
     that I have <emph>found</emph>.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p>
     <emph>You</emph> are married, I hear.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, I also formed an attachment to a young girl that I idolised. You have known me some
     years—that is to say, I was leaving college shortly after you entered, and you know how I have
     ever prized education—that it has been my watchword, my constant theme when I had a seat in
     Parliament. I don’t sit now, but that’s not <emph>my</emph> fault; but when I <emph>did</emph>
     sit, my constant agitation was education. “Educate,” said I, “educate! that is the panacea for
     every social evil!”</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> I’ve read your speeches.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> You should have heard them—will you hear one now?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> Don’t trouble yourself.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Well, after dinner. One day, Sir, in riding through the country, my horse stumbled, and I
     was thrown
     <pb n="8"/> violently. My head encountered the edge of a stone wall; the wall being the hardest
     I was the only sufferer. Stunned and bleeding I was carried into a farm-house. My injuries were
     so severe that I was compelled to remain there for some weeks. The farmer’s daughter constantly
     waited on me, paid me so much attention, so amused me, so anticipated my every wish—in short,
     made herself so necessary to my comforts, that——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> You——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Exactly! I used to watch her every action as I reclined on my sofa. She was rude and odd,
     but there was a heartiness in her nature and a comeliness in her person that pleased me, that
     really fascinated me, till at last I began rather to love her.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> You love an uneducated country wench?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> It was silly, wasn’t it? but we are not our own masters in such matters. However, don’t
     laugh at me yet. I anticipated the pleasure of rightly directing her mind, of the happiness in
     possessing a subject on which to practise my favorite theory—in short, I pictured a whole life
     of felicity in educating the object of my affection.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> For which purpose you married her.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I did, to the great disgust of my connexions; indeed, my uncle, Lord Plato, has never
     visited me since my union—has never written, or noticed me in any way.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> But you found happiness in combining the character of husband and tutor?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I surrounded her with masters—an English master, a French master, a music master, a dancing
     master, a singing master, a philosophical lecturer, and a political economist.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">
    <speaker>Blen.</speaker>
    <p> And what has been her progress?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Her progress has been entirely stationary. I can do nothing with her—she seems to rejoice in
     her ignorance—and, though I sometimes think she has a capacity for learning, my hopes have been
     so often disappointed that I now give her up. She’s a female Orson, Sir, though I confess I was
     once her Valentine.</p>
    <stage type="entrance">Margery, laughs without.</stage>

    <p>—There she is.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, she’s merry enough, and good-humoured enough; but, my dear Sir, with <emph>my</emph>
     prejudices, with <emph>my</emph> ideas of refinement, with <emph>my</emph> delicacy as regards
     conduct in society, conceive my agony in possessing a wife who is as wild as an unbroken colt,
     finds a nickname for everybody, and persists in being called by her Christian name of—of——</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M3">

    <p> What?</p>

    <p> Margery?</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I have tried to persuade her to change it to Matilda, or Magaretta, or Marguerite, but all
     in vain—she says her mother’s name was Margery, her grandmother’s name was Margery, that her
     name is Margery, and Margery she’ll be to the end of the chapter.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_F6">

   <sp who="#L0250_F6">
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> Now, Jack, mind what I say—how many pigs is there in the last litter? Oh, I know—eight!
     Well, you may send one to my cousin Joe—I’ll tell you where he lives by and by—two to my old
     dad, and one to Betsy Buncle, my old playfellow in Lancashire—the three black ones I shall want

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> What with your directions respecting your animals, and your reference to your cousin Joe and
     the old woman your schoolmistress, and your ridiculous eulogium on the uniform of the yeomanry,
     I thought I should have taken to my heels and have run out of the house.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_F6">
    <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
    <p> I wish you had—I know I should have got on much better without <emph>you</emph> at my elbow.
     And as for my cousin Joe, he may be a stupid fellow and all that, but he’s a very good fellow,
     and if he don’t know how to make a proper bow, or a long speech like you do—such as when I’ve
     heard you practising to yourself about railroads, and borrowing money, and taxes, and the state
     of the nation, and situation of the population, and that horrible Education—<emph>he</emph> can
     talk so as I can understand him, and that’s more than I always can when you talk—and anybody
     else, for the matter o’ that. And if I did like the sojers I used to see so often, what harm
     was there in that? I’m sure the Captain was a fine man, a very fine man, whiskers and all—and
     I’ve often looked at him till I’ve felt as if I could eat him.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_M2">
    <speaker>Sir W.</speaker>
    <p> I know that you mean no harm—I know that your heart is pure; but you must learn to be
     conscious of your present station in society. The diamond, though of value in its rough and
     original state, must be polished and set before it can be worn. Now to-day, when I rang for the
     cook and wished you to commence giving your own orders for dinner, and had previously practised
     you in the
     <pb n="13"/> pronunciation of asking for <emph>cabillaud au gratin poulet

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_F6">

     to say, without any beating about the bush; and that’s much better than being deceitful and
     making believe to be glad to see people when you really wish ’em at Jericho, and go grinning
     and smiling up to ’em, and shaking hands, when in your heart you’d like to shake ’em inside
     out—and make use of fine words and say beautiful things when you don’t mean it. You may call it
     polish if you like, but I call it telling lies.</p>

   <stage>Blenheim disappears, R.H.D.—Lady Plato seems confused.</stage>

   <p>—Oh! don’t mind me! I’m so glad I’ve caught you, though, for if such a well-behaved gentleman

    <speaker>Lady P.</speaker>
    <p> Listen, my dear friend. I do not wish it to transpire that I have had an interview with the

     they had better be avoided. I shall therefore rely on your discretion.</p>

    <p> But stop, Polly—wouldn’t it be better not to mind anybody knowing anything? because it don’t
     seem loving and cosy to be sly, and to be frightened every minute in case somebody should say
     something about somebody that would make somebody else angry, and get everybody into trouble,
     and set everybody quarrelling with everybody. I don’t like it, Polly dear! where there’s
     secrets there’s no happiness, and no love—ah! and no goodness, if you come to that.</p>

   <stage>Exit Lady Plato at back.</stage>

   <p>—I just now felt so comfortable when I found myself once more in my old clothes, and was going
    to be so happy and so free, and now I’m in trouble again! I don’t like there being any secrets,
    and I know I’m the worst in the world to keep one—and as to my not telling about the Captain and
    my aunt having seen one another, I may try not to say a word, but it’s sure to slip out after
    dinner. What’s Polly afraid of? why does she want to make believe not to
    <pb n="25"/> know her old sweetheart? and I’m to help her in the make believe! I don’t like it!
    and I feel now as if I had stolen something, and had got it in my pocket, and that somebody was
    coming to search me.</p>

    <p> What’s the matter? why, when you put me in that room full o’ pictur’s, and left me staring
     at ’em while you went to take off your grand clothes, your fine husband came in. “Hallo!” says
     he, “don’t stand in the chairs.” “How can I see the pictures if I don’t?” says I. “Sit down,”
     says he. Well, I did sit down—then he was at me again, and told me to go out of the room, and I
     said I shouldn’t—that my cousin had took me in, and neither he nor six of his servants should
     take me out.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0250_F6">

    <p> That was wrong, Joe.</p>

    <p> Then one word brought up another till I said something and then he said something, and then
