curtains closed; at L . C . a door; at 3 E . L . a door; at 2 E . L . a chest of
drawers; at back, R ., a window; at 3 E . R . a door ; at 2 E . R . a fireplace,

<stage>Cox, dressed, with the exception of his coat, is looking at himself in a
small looking-glass, which he holds in his hand. </stage>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>I've half a mind to register an oath that I'll never have my hair cut again!
<stage>(his hair is very short)</stage>I look as if I had just been cropped for
the Militia! And I was particularly emphatic in my instructions to the
hair-dresser only to cut the ends off. He must have thought I meant the other
ends ! Never mind—I shan't meet anybody to care about so early. Eight o'clock, I
declare! I haven't a moment to lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual,
particular, and peremptory of hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny.
<stage>(knock at l. c. d.)</stage>Open locks, whoever knocks!</p>
</sp>
<stage> Enter Mrs. Bouncer. </stage>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Good morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept comfortably, Mr. Cox ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>I can't say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged to you, if you could
accommodate me with a more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one I've got now
seems to me to have about a handful and a half of feathers at each end, and
nothing whatever in the middle.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Thank you. Then perhaps you'll be good enough to hold this glass, while I
finish my toilet.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Certainly. <stage>(holding glass before Cox, who ties on his
cravat)</stage>Why, I do declare, you've had your hair cut!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Cut ? It strikes me I've had it mowed! It's very kind of you to mention it,
but I'm sufficiently conscious of the absurdity of my personal appearance
already. <stage>(puts on his coat)</stage>Now for my hat― <stage>(puts on his
hat, which comes over his eyes)</stage>That's the effect of having one's hair
cut. This hat fitted me quite tight <pb n="4"/> before. Luckily I've got two or
three more. <stage>(goes in at l. d. and returns, with three hats of different
shapes, and puts them on, one after the other — all of which are too big for
him)</stage>This is pleasant! Never mind. This one appears to me to wabble about
rather less than the others <stage>(puts on hat)</stage>and now I'm off! By the
bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your attention to a fact that has been evident
to me for some time past—and that is, that my coals go remarkably fast―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Lor, Mr. Cox !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>It is not only the case with the coals, Mrs. Bouncer, but I've lately
observed a gradual and steady increase of evaporation among my candles, wood,
sugar, and lucifer matches.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Lor, Mr. Cox ! you surely don't suspect me ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>I don't say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you distinctly to understand, that I
don't believe it's the cat.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p> Is there anything else you've got to grumble about, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a thing as a dictionary ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>No, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Then I'll lend you one—and if you turn to the letter G., you'll find
"Grumble, verb neuter—to complain without a cause." Now that's not my case, Mrs.
B. And now that we are upon the subject, I wish to know how it is that I
frequently find my apartment full of smoke ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Why—I suppose the chimney―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>The chimney doesn't smoke tobacco. I'm speaking of tobacco smoke, Mrs. B. I
hope, Mrs. . B.uncer, <emph>you're</emph> not guilty of cheroots or cubas ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Nor partial to a pipe ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>No, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Then how is it that―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(confused)</stage>Why—I suppose—yes—that must be it― </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>At present, I am entirely of your opinion—because I haven't the most distant
particle of an idea what you mean.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Why, the gentleman who has got the attics, is hardly ever without a pipe in
his mouth—and there he sits, with his feet on the mantel-piece―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>The mantel-piece! That strikes me as being a considerable stretch, either of
your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman's legs. I presume you mean the
fender or the hob.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Sometimes one, sometimes t'other. Well, there he sits for hours, and puffs
away into the fire-place.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Ah, then you mean to say, that this gentleman's smoke, instead of emulating
the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going <emph>up</emph> the chimney,
thinks proper to affect a singularity by taking the contrary direction ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>B. Why―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Then I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of, is the same individual
that I invariably meet coming up stairs when I'm going down, and going down when
I'm coming up ?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="5"/>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Why―yes—I―</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly set him down
as a gentleman connected with the printing interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir—and a very respectable young gentleman he is.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Well, good morning, Mrs. Bouncer!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>You'll be back at your usual time, I suppose, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Yes—nine o'clock. You needn't light my fire in future, Mrs. B.—I'll do it
myself. Don't forget the bolster ! <stage>(going, stops)</stage>A halfpenny
worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer—and be good enough to let it stand—I wish the cream
to accumulate. <stage>Exit at l. c. d.</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>He's gone at last! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear Mr. Box should
come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they've never met yet—and what's more,
they're not very likely to do so: for Mr. Box is hard at work at a newspaper
office all night, and doesn't come home till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy
making hats all day long, and doesn't come home till night; so that I'm getting
double rent for my room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It
was a capital idea of mine— that it was! But I haven't an instant to lose. First
of all, let me put Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. <stage>(she takes the
three hats, Cox's dressing gown and slippers, opens door at L . and puts them
in, then shuts door and locks it)</stage>Now then, to put the key where Mr. Cox
always finds it. <stage>(puts the key on the ledge of the door L .)</stage>I
really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was so dreadfully puzzled to
know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it. Now, then, to make the bed—and
don't let me forget that what's the head of the bed for Mr. Cox, becomes the
foot of the bed for Mr. Box—peoples' tastes do differ so. <stage>(goes behind
the curtains of the bed, and seems to be making it — then appears with a very
thin bolster in her hand)</stage>The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of
such a bolster as this! <stage>(she disappears again behind
curtains)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(without)</stage>Pooh—pooh! Why don't you keep your own side of the
staircase, sir ? <stage>(enters at back, dressed as a Printer — puts his head
out at door again, shouting)</stage>It was as much your fault as mine, sir! I
say, sir—it was as much your fault as mine, sir!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(emerging from behind the curtains of bed)</stage>Lor, Mr. Box! what is
the matter?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>Mind your own business, Bouncer!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in, to be sure! I declare you're
quite pale in the face !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>What colour would you have a man he, who has been setting up long leaders for
a daily paper all night ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>But then, you've all the day to yourself.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(looking significantly at Mrs. Bouncer)</stage>So it seems! Far be it
from me, Bouncer, to hurry your movements, but I think it right to acquaint you
with my immediate intention of divesting myself of my garments, and going to
bed.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>B. Oh, Mr. Box! <stage>(going)</stage></p>
</sp>
<pb n="6"/>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably encounter
going down stairs when I'm coming up, and coming up stairs when I'm going down
?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(confused)</stage>Oh—yes—the gentleman in the attic, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>Oh; There's nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his hats. I
meet him in all sorts of hats—white hats and black hats—hats with broad brims,
and hats with narrow brims- hats with naps, and hats without naps—in short, I
have come to the conclusion, that he must be individually and professionally
associated with the hatting interest.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir. And, by-the-bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of you, as a
particular favour, that you would not smoke quite so much.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>Did he ? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments, that if he
objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better domesticate himself in some
adjoining parish.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Mr. Box! You surely wouldn't deprive me of a lodger ?
<stage>(pathetically)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because if I detect the
slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you warning that I shall
give you warning at once.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Well, Mr. Box—do you want anything more of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>On the contrary—I've had quite enough of you !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_F3">
<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>Well, if ever ! What next, I wonder ? <stage>(goes out at l. c. d. slamming
door after her)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>It's quite extraordinary, the trouble I always have to get rid of that
venerable female ! She know I'm up all night, and yet she seems to set her face
against my indulging in a horizontal position by day. Now, let me see—shall I
take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or shall I take my breakfast before I
swallow my nap—I mean, shall I swallow my nap before—no— never mind! I've got a
rasher of bacon somewhere— <stage>(feeling in his pockets)</stage>—I've the most
distinct and vivid recollection of having purchased a rasher of bacon—Oh, here
it is— <stage>(produces it, wrapped in paper, and places it on
table)</stage>—and a penny roll. The next thing is to light the fire. Where are
my lucifers ? <stage>(looking on mantel-piece r. and taking box, opens
it)</stage>Now, 'pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer—this is, by several
degrees, too bad ! I had a whole box full, three days ago, and now there's only
one! I'm perfectly aware that she purloins my coals and my candles, and my
sugar—but I did think—oh, yes, I did think that my lucifers would be sacred!
<stage>(takes candlestick of the mantel-piece, r. in which there is a very small
end of candle — looks at it)</stage>Now I should like to ask any unprejudiced
person or persons their opinion touching this candle. In the first place, a
candle is an article that I don't require, because I'm only at home in the day
time—and I bought this candle on the first of May—Chimney-sweepers' day
—calculating that it would last me three months, and here's one week not half
over, and the candle three parts gone! <stage>(lights the fire — then takes down
the gridiron, which is hanging over the fireplace, E.)</stage>Mrs. Bouncer has
been using my gridiron ! The last article <pb n="7"/> of consumption that I
cooked upon it was a pork chop, and now it is powerfully impregnated with the
odour of red herrings ! <stage>(places gridiron on fire, and then, with a fork,
lays rasher of bacon on the gridiron)</stage>How sleepy I am, to be sure ! I'd
indulge myself with a nap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning
of my bacon. <stage>(yawning again)</stage>Perhaps it will turn itself. I must
lie down—so, here goes— <stage>He lies down on the bed, closing the curtains
round him — after a short pause</stage> —</p>
</sp>
<stage> Enter Cox, hurriedly, L . C .</stage>
<sp who="#L0073_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of being eleven minutes and a half
behind time. I was sneaking into the shop, in a state of considerable
excitement, when my venerable employer, with a smile of extreme benevolence on
his aged countenance, said to me—" Cox, I shan't want you to-day—you can have a
holiday." Thoughts of "Gravesend and back—fare One Shilling," instantly
suggested themselves, intermingled with visions of "Greenwich for Fourpence ! "
Then came the Twopenny Omnibusses, and the Halfpenny boats—in short, I'm quite
bewildered! However, I must have my breakfast first—that'll give me time to
reflect. I've bought a mutton chop, so I shan't want any dinner. <stage>(puts
chop on table)</stage>Good gracious! I've forgot the bread. Holloa! what's this?
A roll, I declare. Come that's lucky! Now then, to light the fire. Holloa—
<stage>(seeing the lucifer box on table)</stage>—who presumes to touch my box of
lucifers? Why, it's empty! I left one in it—I'll take my oath I did. Heyday! why
the fire is lighted Where's the gridiron ? <emph>On</emph> the fire, I declare.
And what's that on it? Bacon? Bacon it is! Well, now, 'pon my life, there is a
quiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer's proceedings that's almost amusing. She takes
my last lucifer— my coals, and my gridiron, to cook her breakfast by ! No, no—I
can't stand this! Come out of that! <stage>(pokes fork into bacon, and puts it
on a plate on the table, then places his chop on the gridiron, which he puts on
the fire)</stage>Now, then, for my breakfast things. <stage>(taking key, hung up
L , opens door L, and goes out, slamming the door after him, with a loud
noise)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0073_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(suddenly showing his head from behind curtains)</stage>Come in! if it's
you, Mrs. Bouncer—you needn't be afraid. I wonder how long I've been asleep !
<stage>(suddenly recollecting)</stage>Goodness gracious —my bacon! <stage>(leaps
off bed, and runs to the fireplace)</stage>Holloa! what's this? A chop? Whose
chop? Mrs. Bouncer's, I'll be bound. She thought to cook her breakfast while I
was asleep— with <emph>my</emph> coals, too—and my gridiron. Ha, ha ! But
