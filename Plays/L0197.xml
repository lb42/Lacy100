<head>Willikind and his Dinah.</head>
<p>In presenting this Doleful Tragedy for the first time on the Stage of any
Theatre, it is believed that a few particulars relative to its literary history
will neither prove unimportant nor uninteresting. The play itself, which has
been recently discovered amongst the papers of a retired Cheesemonger, belongs
apparently to the Elizabethan period ; a supposition rendered more probable by a
Latin inscription on the fly-leaf, which, though nearly obliterated by time, may
be decyphered thus:—"Mihi et Betti Martini," signifying, doubtless, the names of
the joint Authors as Myself and Elizabeth Martin names which, though not
familiar, perhaps, to the students of our early dramatic history, are yet of no
rare occurrence in popular literature. As the most indefatigable researches in
the British Museum have failed to bring to light any quarto or folio edition of
“Ye Tragicalle Hystorie of Willikind and his Dinah, with ye manner of theyre
love-makynge, ye cruelle Parent’s enmitie, and theyre most pittiful ends,” there
is reason to believe that it was never printed, and, consequently, it is fair to
assume that it was never published. The original story on which the plot was
based seems equally to have baffled the investigation of those who sought to
trace the legend to its primitive source. An anonymous writer in a work dated
1583, and entitled “A Paradise of Curious Conceits and Daintie Devices,” alludes
to a similar story, in which a Parent refuses consent to a Daughter’s Marriage.
The name of Willikind, however, seems unknown in the Parish Registers before
1602, when it figures in an entry, which would seem to show that a person of
that name then existed; but whether it was the same individual—there is now no
possible method of ascertaining.—Dinah, or Dian-ah—the interjection “ah!” having
been palpably appended to the first syllable to express the melancholy nature of
her career,—has been often made the subject of reference by the lyrists of
Ethiopia, but there is no reason for supposing that they could throw any light
on the present history. Under these circumstances, as it appears that no
information can be gained by pursuing the inquiry any further, it seems to be
most advisable to desist from the attempt, and the curious in these
etymological, genealogical, and archaeological researches are, therefore,
confidently referred to the Tragedy itself, which will be found to embrace all
the particulars hitherto unknown and unrecorded.</p>

<div type="scene">
<stage type="setting">SCENE I.—"The Front Garding" of the Rich Merchant's
Mansion, at Hackney. At the back a high clipped hedge enclosing the garden. A
large scroll-work iron gate in centre of the hedge with two stone piers,
surmounted by statues of grotesque lions. Through the gate is seen a road and
country landscape. The front of the Merchant's Mansion (R.H.) with practicable
door, and window above opening on a balcony. The garden is laid out in grass
plats, gravelled walks, and parterres—box-wood trees clipped into fantastical
forms ; a rustic seat, watering pot, garden roller. A water-butt painted green,
at comer of garden next the house, U. B., a pair of green library steps beside
the water-butt. Time, sunrise. The Barcarole, from Masaniello, played on a
flageolet by Willikind at a distance, and gradually approaching; the sparrows on
all sides twitter an accompaniment to the music. Willikind then appears outside
the gate (c.), looks over, and sings.</stage>

<l>Oh, downy couch! and far more downier maid ! </l>
<l>Perchance she snores! and, snoring, dreams of me, </l>
<l>Her Willikind. But soft! the morning breaks. </l>
<l>And rises like a baker in the (y)east ;</l>
<l>While, through the blanket of the night, his rays </l>
<l>Like streaks upon a Ribston pippin shine.</l>

<stage>Plays "Away with Melancholy," on his flageolet; the sparrows, as before,
twittering an accompaniment. At the close of the air, Dinah opens upper window,
