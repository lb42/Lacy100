<head>ACT I. </head>
<div type="scene">
<head>Scene I. </head>
<stage>The Quay of St. Helier's, Jersey. Fort Regent extending along the L.; St.
Aubin's Bay flowing at the back, with Castle Elizabeth in the distance; a yatch
at anchor, and other craft; L. and R. are shops, with French names over the
door; R., “Michael Bitaube,” “Marchand de Vine”— L., “Pierre Vimand,” “Coiffeur
et Peruquier.”</stage>
<stage>As the Curtain rises, a group of Normandy Girls are discovered R. U. E.,
with baskets of fruit, &amp;c.; L. U. E., before the Barber's door, an old
French Soldier, a Priest, and a Tradesman are seated smoking, and reading a
newspaper;—at the back in the centre stand a group of Jersey Sailors looking off
at the bay through glasses; cries are then heard as of a boat mooring:— “Garde
Garde—Prenez la corde;” A rope is now thrown to the group in centre, who make it
fast to a post, R. U. E.</stage>
<stage>Prong advances from L. U. E.</stage>

<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>O, ho! the Southampton packet! Who does she bring to-day, I wonder?—any one
in my way?</p>
</sp>
<stage>A party of Passengers mount the quay, R. U. E., and pass off, L.,
followed by the Normandy Girls crying Madame, Monsieur, will you buy, if you
please?—The party at the Barber's door then rise and enter the shop.</stage>

<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p> Yes, yes; a very respectable party. Oh, the town's filling—money will be
spent here—my scheme must succeed. Yes, after rambling all my days in order to
effect my great object, here I rest at last in the Island of Jersey—Jersey,
which I mean to render the model of watering places. Brighton was too hot for
me; a positive oven—with the sea always serving as a block-tin
reflector;—Hastings too high again; people climbing all day there like rats in a
cistern;—but here is the very thing; a beautiful country—a magnificent sea—all
the elements at hand, wanting only the creative mind to bring their charms to
<pb n="4"/> a focus—and here is the focus. <stage>(takes out a copy book and
reads)</stage> “Prospectus of assembly rooms to be built in St. Helier's by
shares and subscriptions; limited liability”—nothing like that! “and opened
under the direction of Charles Claude Prong, Esq., M.C.A.H.M.S.,” which, of
course, is to say—Master of Ceremonies, at Her Majesty's Service. There's my
grand plan;— “The St. Helier's Assembly Room Company, Limited”—not, by the bye,
that I want the company limited—and here's my list of subscribers, consisting at
present of one—my friend Lascelles; but then everything must have a beginning,
and— <stage>Bitaube comes from his shop, R.</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Good morning, Monsieur Prong.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Bitaube, my boy, how are you to-day? What's   for dinner?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Dinner, sare?—nosing, sare, nosing.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you mean to say nothing to astonish me;— merely a bit of salmon, or
chicken, or—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>No, sare, dere is no shicken; dere is nosing here but an old goose, and him
you have live on long enough.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Moi, sare—myself—you have been wis me six weeks, and pay me nosing but
compliment.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>But haven't I ensured you? haven't I recommended you to some of my first
friends in London—a mass of rank and fashion who will come over and patronize
you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Oh, bah, bah!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Bah, bah, sir!—that's the language of a sheep not a goose. I say that
actuated by a spirit of the purest philanthropy,—I have worked night and day to
benefit you and your island—to build a decoy-duck, in the shape of
assembly-rooms.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yase; you build beautiful room, but he is all in de cloud, sare—he is all
in de air!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>So is oxygen in the air, sir, but we contrive to get hold of it! My scheme
may be vapory, may be only floating at present; but here's its condenser, here's
my prospectus. And what's a prospectus? Why the talisman of commerce—the great
charm of the stock market, with which we conjure up   capital faster than a
witch could do spirits; with a few waves of this, and up go my rooms, and once
they are up, not a fashionable bird of passage, but will perch on this
island.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Or perhaps, de bird of prey. Here is my bill, sare, will you pay him if you
please?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<stage> (taking it)</stage>
<p>Fifteen pounds odd.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Certainment, if you, please.</p>
<pb n="5"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Very good, then I'll tell you what we'll do—I won't pay you this money. I'll
do a better thing than that—I'll invest it for you, and then you know it will
give you an income. I'll put you down for a couple of shares.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>A couple of share?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>That will be twenty pounds, and as you'll then owe me five, you can hand me
the difference.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Why, I am putrified.</p>

</sp>
<stage>Duparc mounts the quay, Sailor and luggage, R. U. E., and
advances.</stage>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Now, then, to look round and find some of my acquaintance—Bitaube!</p>

<sp who="#L0466_M7">

<p>Yes, my friend, it is I, after a long three years' absence.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Quel bonheur! Why, mon brave, we all thought you were dead.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>   And really with some reason considering the climate I've been in—that of a
land where disease and peril were my hourly companions—but it pleased heaven to
preserve me, and to repay my hard labours. I am happy to say, I have returned,
not only with enough for all my own wants, but to spare to an old friend, should
I find one less fortunate.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">

<p>What a noble-hearted fellow. I see a subscriber!</p>

</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<stage> (detaining him)</stage>
<p>No, no, you must first delight me; you know how many here are dear to me, and
one above all, Marie—she is well?</p>

<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Oh, oui, quite well.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Thank heaven! I have not heard from her for a year past, and I almost feared
to ask the question.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<stage> (aside)</stage>
<p>Oho, a wife in view—a double subscription!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">

<p>She's still with her kind protector?</p>

</sp>

<p>Bless my soul, sir, is the lady you allude to,— that very charming person
I've seen with Major Audley?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, his adopted daughter.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Then, I must say a real one couldn't have been worthier of his taste.</p>
<pb n="6"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>   Say, rather, sir, his heart.—She was the orphan of a fisherman, whom he
gave a home to in infancy, but he was soon well rewarded,—the grave had made him
solitary, and she became more than child to him, she proved his friend and his
staff.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Oui, and his pair of spectacles, for since he have got blind—</p>
</sp>

<p>Blind!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">

</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Not a word.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">

<p>Oh, yase—tres malheureux—he nevare go out now, but Marie have to lead
him.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>And so charmingly she does it, sir, you'd really imagine that to lose your
sight was the true way to enjoy walking.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Poor Mr. Audley!—but Bitaube, this is a sad life for Marie.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Oh, vare sad—vare—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Sad, sir, I say it's horrible—you don't know how I've pitied her—a girl so
young and lovely, shut out from all amusements, not even an assembly-room to go
to—such an evil must be remedied. We must build rooms—we must build them and I
trust, sir, that in a purpose so purely philanthropical, I may count on your
assistance.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M7">
<speaker>Duparc.</speaker>
<p>Of course, you may heartily.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>   Of course, I may heartily; I was sure you would say that, sir—so allow me
with great pleasure to put you down for a ten pound share, one pound
deposit.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M8">
<speaker>Bitaube.</speaker>
<p>Diable take de share, is dis a time for business? Come in, my friend, and sit

<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Come, my book's improving, just now I had but one name—now I've got a
couple—a couple—I see the approach of a whole army of subscribers; this Duparc
suggests a host. The first step is the difficulty, it is to set the machine
going, once off it goes by itself, goes freely and goes rapidly; especially if
its progress should happen to be down hill.</p>

<p> Eh, my friend, Lascelles, landing from his yacht. Now, shall I stay and get
his deposit or—what are they doing in the shop, there? actually attacking a leg
of pork!—their raptures over they go to dinner—they seek to give increased
foundation to the pleasure of this meeting. Well, that really seems very
sensible as well as very genial, so I'll just step in <pb n="7"/> and show them
that my nature on this point is as open as their own. <stage>(enters the

readily as the fruit they bring to market. Ah! if you had but talked to her; if
you had but passed as I have done but one evening by her side—you would not

<p> I grow too querulous: the clinging thought that sight will be restored to me
makes every day more bitter at its close, since met with hope, instead of
resignation. And yet ought I not to be thankful? I might have been deserted in
my need—left to the selfish care of strangers, who would have watched me only
for the pittance that I paid them. When, now I have a friend who mingles all the
feeling of a mother with a child; who anticipates my wants, dispels my cares,
and brings back with her freshness and her soft kind voice—the sunshine and the
air of the fair world I am shut out from.</p>

fixed on begining here; a lovely country, a glorious sea, offering every scope
to philanthropic views—wanting only the presiding mind to give their elements
cohesion, and therefore, sir, feeling as I do assured— that all this great moral
and intellectual good can only be accomplished by means of an assembly room,—I
trust you'll support me in the one I mean to build, and allow me to put you down

<stage>—Interior of an Assembly Room. A bare wooden building, with doors, R. and

opens on the high road; bills hung about the walls headed “Assembly Rooms,

<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Dear, dear, what a life people lead who've got to work for the public—to be
servant of everyone, and mistress of nobody. I thought when this place was
building, I was going to be a lady—that I should have nothing to do but to wear
a nice dress, and give orders all day; I never supposed I was going to order
myself—I was to be head of the establishment, but such a one as this is just
like a canal boat—it's head and tail are both the same; and it will be worse
when the rooms open—then I shall have to help fill 'em, as well as keep 'em
clean—sell the tickets, and make the tea; well, there's certainly one comfort, I
shan't have to drink it.</p>

<p>Sad, sir? it was very infamous—to desert my poor misses only a month after

<speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
<p>I grant it.</p>

English—and all, merely because he'd got a rich cousin.</p>

<p>'Twas a hard fate, certainly. And what became of her? I suppose her father

<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>He took her to Southampton, sir, but there, after a bit, he fell ill and
died; and as my misses was then destitute and had no home to go to—I did not
think it too much to take her into mine.</p>

<p>Into yours?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_F11">
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir—I couldn't see her want—besides she was so ill—she no sooner crossed
our door, than she was forced to take to her bed; and for six weeks or more, I
never thought she'd quit it—and though it's true, she was able yesterday to
crawl abroad for half-an-hour, yet—ah! sir, I wouldn't be the   man who has
caused all this misery—he may have gained all he wished—he may have got a rich
wife—and be living in grandeur —but I can't think he's happy—after the wrong he
has done,— such people may have their carriages—their wine, and fine dresses
—but, unless they can stop thinking—they can't but fear the time will come, when
they themselves will get served—just as they have treated others.</p>

weapon that was raised against you, has recoiled on <pb n="36"/> its employer.
And to be renounced by the man I had served— that I had saved, even from

<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Good evening, sir, a thousand apologies for this dishabille, but on the eve
of opening a great establishment you konw the confusion. The fact is, I had
employed an artist to decorate my exterior, but found him so deficient in that
delicacy of touch as well as breadth of expression that forms so nice   a point
of art—in the department of white-washing—I was obliged to dismiss him; and,
however awkwardly it may sound, sir, to white-wash myself.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M3">
<speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
<p>Old friend, do you forget me?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Is it possible, Rawdon! Well, I'm vastly glad to see you,—so here I am you
see, fixed at last; the great object of my life accomplished—my assembly rooms
erected.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M3">
<speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
<p>So—I perceive.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>And with every arrangement to ensure their prosperity. Here is my supper
room—there my card room—and yonder is my orchestra, capable of holding ten
instruments besides the big drum—on that point I am strong. My band, especially
in its brasses, is wholly unequalled; I believe that my brass, sir, is not to be
matched—and as to our strings— you hear of musical chords that pull in the
public; put my strings together, and they are as strong as a rope, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M3">
<speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
<p>Well, I am sorry I can't stay to hear them.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Oh, but you must stay, if its only in justice to me. I'm not only manager and
musical conductor, I'm also composer. Great occasions, you know, develope great
powers: the opening of my rooms required to be marked by a new overture—so I
walked about for half an hour, and whistled a grand one.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M3">
<speaker>Rawdon.</speaker>
<p>Whistled it?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>Whistled it—to Stoggings, my leader, and he says it's a masterpiece. Its
particular merit lies in its power of description,   and on this head I don't
think music has ever gone further. As, for instance, I call it “The Fall of
Algiers,” and I commence with the sailing of the fleet—a pizzicato movement for
the hoisting of the sails—and a solo on the trumpet to suggest the bosn's
whistle. In part three, I describe the old admiral—an adagio movement to depict
the moral qualities of a nautical commander—and I wind it all up with a modern
imitation of a terrible bombardment—the whistling of bullets—the bawling of
sailors—the neighing of horses—the crowiug of cocks—the downfall of the
Turks—and the triumph of British principles.</p>

<p>No, sir,—I don't say that.</p>

<p>But I say it—and with reason. Susan, I bring her news, that would almost
raise her from the grave. I know, and cannot condemn your indignation at your
late master. His treachery fully justified the abhorence you've expressed, but
still he had excuses—it was not pride as you suppose, but want that caused his
treachery. He loved your mistress deeply, but if he could only prove his truth
to her at the hazard of a prison —must not some excuse be found for him in his
dismay and his despair?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_F11">
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Why, certainly, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p> Be assured, Susan, that from the day he left her he has not known a moment's
peace; his life has been but a protracted torture—hourly she has been before
him, in all her   desolation; and she not only—but the seared look of her poor
deserted father. His one prayer has been to atone to her, and at length that
prayer is granted—he had told his story to his <pb n="38"/> cousin, a good and
generous girl, and she had released him from his contract—but still his uncle
was unyielding and resolved on its completion. For three months that girl
entreated him, and entreated him in vain—but love like hers was not to be
defeated, within this week she has prevailed—Lascelles is pardoned—and is free
to maintain his vows to Marie. <stage>(Rawdon opens the R. door returning, and

<p>Mr. Lascelles come back! come back to my poor misses to make her his true and
lawful wife! I must be dreaming—yet—no Mr Markland says so—and I know he
wouldn't   deceive me, ha! ha! oh! isn't this delightful! I'm so happy
—I—I—should like to cry, only I haven't time—and yet here I stand idling, when I
ought to run and tell her—never mind the rooms—if they don't open for a
month—I've got to wash the floor—but my husband can do that—and then go home,
and fry some sausages—but he can do that too.—Dear, dear—only let me see her
once more happy—and I don't think I should be wretched, if I was to bury Mr.

<p>So, then, Lascelles is free—and has returned to requite his victim. Are there
not two here he should requite? Why should I leave England, seeking beggary
abroad to avoid punishment at home—when he, who was the cause of my
imprudence—can save me from its consequence? What made me use his name, but his
own breach of faith to me? And with a hundred pounds I could regain the bill—he
is now as rich as ever, and must assist me, eh—is not that he approaching? Yes;
he has broken away from Markland, and hurries here half mad with joy, to clasp
the feet of his forsaken—well, be it so—let hers be the first meeting—mine shall
be the second.</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>
</sp>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p> And if that doesn't slide off a few “family packets” I am no judge of music.
The fact is, I have found out in regard to music, that the conducting's
everything; for what would the public know of it, if the conductor didn't
explain it to them? A conductor in an orchestra, like one on the roof of a
house—is an instrument to catch the electric fluid and transmit it to its
recipients; I've studied in a good school; I've seen all the modern bands in
London and in Paris, and I know all their evolutions—you always begin in this
way. <stage>(he flourishes his roll, a la Jullien)</stage> With three good
broad-sword slashes for a grand crash, in order to rouse attention—and then a
series of gentle flutterings, like a sea gull going to dive—to waft the wind
away into luxurious repose—presently a sudden burst, to create a slight
perplexity—a hurry skurry of the fiddles, to make them ask, what's coming
now—followed by a boom of the trombones, and a shriek of the French horns, as
though you were going to   charge them with a whole jungle of wild elephants—and
then <pb n="45"/> when you are well at work—booming, screaming, thundering, till
the audience begin to stare like a lot of delighted bedlamites; you calm the
storm, and soothe all down till you look as if you were sinking in a warm sea
bath. <stage>(a loud knocking, L.)</stage> Ah! the company to dinner. I've a
great mind to bring that knocker into my overture, it would do a bit of the
bombarding capitally. <stage>Servant crosses from L. hurriedly.</stage> Told
your master, John? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M14">
<speaker>Servant.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; but I must go now to my mistress, for here's Mr. Lascelles at the
door with a lady that's fainted.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p>A lady that's fainted?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M14">
<speaker>Servant.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; Mr. Lascelles has been attacked, sir; just escaped with his life,
so he's brought the lady here, and— you'll excuse me, if you please, sir?</p>
<stage>   He runs off, R. 1 E.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p> Lascelles been attacked?—how very unfortunate! this will keep back the
dinner half an hour—perhaps, too, spoil my music. My band must be in the way:
I'll call them in. Gentlemen, will you step here, if you please? <stage>Enter
three Villagers, with a fiddle, drum, and trumpet, L. 1 E.</stage> Gentlemen,
I'm sorry to say, that owing to a little discord abroad, our harmony is likely
to be interfered with within. However, we'll take our places on the lawn, and
ascertain the distance at which we ought to stand. Distance, you know, has much
to do with music—some we like near, some far off—and I wish to see, from your
peculiar style of playing, whether yours would be most enjoyed near, or very far
off. So follow   me to the lawn—and allow me to say—that as I'm your conductor,
I allow of no stoppages. <stage>   They go off, R. 1 E.</stage>
<stage>Enter Markland and Lascelles, L. 1 E.</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Why, Lascelles, this story of your attack, and your rescue at the hands of
Marie, sounds like a romance.—Let me trust, however, that the only fiction, is
your belief—that her mind is diseased.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M2">
<speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
<p>Have I not told you her delusion—that the evening on which I left her is
still passing—that my friends are still assembling—and I, that she saw leave her
in a carriage, am not returning to rejoin them.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>I see—'twas the scene on which her senses closed— and it has burnt into her
brain—and oddly enough—to-night, that you bring her here—I have some friends to
dinner, and a dance—and—Lascelles—a thought—what if we tested this delusion—what
if we realized the scene—which she imagines to be passing.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M2">
<speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
<p>Realized it.</p>
<pb n="46"/>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Aye—place her in that room once more, where her reason left her—and there
surround her with the same images, and forms—and voices—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M2">
<speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
<p>And then—?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Do you not think that such a pressure on her senses, would recall them.—And
fortunately, as this is still your old house—the attempt could be made
to-night—the room is still the same—or here is Susan, who remembers how 'twas
furnished—and   will help us to re-arrange it.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M2">
<speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
<p>But still—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay—if the scheme holds out the slightest ground of hope—'tis our duty
to attempt it—be the issue what it may.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M2">
<speaker>Lascel.</speaker>
<p>I feel it is—but pardon me if struggle as I may, the thought will come—</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>That after all her suffering—some joy is yet in store for her. </p>
<stage>(they go off, L. 1 E.)</stage>
<stage>Prong returns, R. 1 E.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M5">
<speaker>Prong.</speaker>
<p> There—I've placed the band in a capital position— on the bank of the pond—so
if they happen to slip in, their notes will be more liquid—and I think this is a
good distance, two hundred yards—so here I shall try the effect of my
production. I hope they'll play it with expression—particularly the bit about
the admiral—the ten bars that describe the moral qualities of a good
commander—by the bye—I was thinking, whether I couldn't improve that, by making
the Admiral a Renegade—and then I could have some music to describe a man going
into a foreign country—and changing his religion— well—they can see me here—so
I'll give them the signal—now, gentlemen—begin. <stage>  (he stands looking off,
R., and flourishes; a bray of discords follow from the band)</stage> Hallo!
what's that?—stop, stop! <stage>  (their noise goes on increasing; he
alternately flourishes and stops his ears, and at last rushes off to silence
them)</stage> Scene IV. <stage>—The Parlours of the Villa (as in Scene III., Act
II., furnished and lit in the same manner)</stage>
<stage>Susan runs in from the lawn, smartly dressed, (as in Act II.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_F11">
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p> Gracious me! what a thought of Mr. Markland's, to try to recover missus, by
making her believe that the scene she is always thinking of is actually going
on; it's not at all a bad notion, and should it succeed, she'll never know what
she has suffered, or remember it only as a dream—and sure enough we can try it,
for here we are in our old house, and the rooms <pb n="47"/> just as they
were—not a chair changed, that I can see—everything looks the same;—I wonder
whether I look the same! <stage>(goes to a glass)</stage> Well, pretty much,
though to be sure, a girl's face is not so good for that matter, as a bit of
mahogany—mahogany we know, improves by hard rubs—in fact it gets polished; but I
can't say adversity has done as much good for me. <stage>Markland comes from R.
door.</stage>
</p>

<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Now, Susan is, all in order?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_F11">
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir; perhaps this table stood a little more here, and our flower stand,
I think, was opposite. </p>
<stage>(she changes their places rapidly)</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_M4">
<speaker>Mark.</speaker>
<p>Prepare, then—for whilst lying in her stupor, my wife succeeded in
transforming her; in a few moments she will be here; you know your lesson—but be
cautious.</p>
<stage>   He goes out at back, through R.</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0466_F11">
<speaker>Susan.</speaker>
<p> Be cautious! that's easy advice to give, but not so easy to take, when a
body is so flustered;—I'm sure I shall make some blunder—I shall try to do it so
well—I shall be able to do nothing—I shouldn't at all wonder if I wasn't able to
speak at all! <stage>Enter Marie, R., dressed as in last scene of Act II., and
advances in a reverie.</stage> Ahem!—Madam!—Mrs. Lascelles! </p>
