     <stage>SCENE.—The hall of the "Rose and Crown Inn" (a picturesque old fashioned interior)
      principal entrance at back—S. of entrance a large glass window, L. of entrance (in flat)
      another door; each door is numbered. Two doors R. two doors L., over doors are seen large
      stags heads with antlers. Near centre a table, between doors L. another table—oaken chairs
      &amp;c, &amp;c.—through C. door (at back)—a distant view of village is seen. At the rising of
      the curtain loud hammering of table and jingling of glasses accompanied with shouts of
      laughter heard R. Bob discovered.</stage>

      <speaker>Bob.</speaker>
      <stage>(throwing himself into a chair)</stage>
      <p>Well I'm reg'lar run off my legs, and that's just about the size of it. We have got a tidy
       houseful at the "Rose and Crown" this here eventful day—<stage>(pointing to door in
        flat)</stage> No. 1—the annual dinner of the "Social Farmers." No 2—<stage>(pointing L. U.
        E.)</stage> Wedding breakfast, tip top swells with musicianers and dancing, and all manner
       of feeshionable capers ; the bar's quite full o' genl'man's servants as is a consooming every
       drop o' moisture on the premises, <stage>(fanning himself with napkin)</stage> I declare I
       ain't been in such a wiolent perspiration ever since I first flourished a dish-kivver !</p>

      <stage>(alone—sarcastically)</stage>
      <p>What a delightful thing it
       <pb n="4"/>is to serve one's fellow creatures at sixty per cent, clear profit; the bridegroom
       is positively maudlin in the expression of his gratitude ; well, he <hi>ought</hi> to be
       obliged to me, racketty young dog ! but for my timely and (ahem !) <hi>disinterested</hi>
       assistance, he would have been at this moment in prison: thanks to <hi>me</hi> this ruined
       spendthrift has secured a wife with a snug fortune. He borrowed five thousand of me, to
       deposit at his banker's, for a week, <stage>(Jeeringly)</stage> ha ! ha ! as a <hi>decoy</hi>
       for his worthy father-in-law. I advanced the money, in the way of business, on strong
       security ; for this little accommodation I charge my young friend the reasonable interest of
       a thousand pounds; on the strength of which little bonus I have consented to officiate as
       "best man" on this auspicious occasion, <stage>(with a sardonic laugh)</stage> ha! ha! these
       little friendly speculations pay vastly better than the Stock Exchange !</p>

      <speaker>Raff.</speaker>
      <p>Ah! Mr Sands, there you are ! <stage>(pointing off)</stage> they'll make a charming couple,
       won't they ? Ah ! Mr. Sands, I can never thank you sufficiently for introducing to me so
       excellent a son-in-law. Ah ! Mr. Sands, what a <hi>good</hi> man you are ! you seem to divide
       your time equally between business and benevolence. I say, how about that "Coal and

      <p>I'm delighted to hear it, for I confess to being ravenously hungry, <stage>(to Raffles,
        sanctimoniously)</stage> Ah ! my dear Raffles, depend upon it, the consciousness of a

      <speaker>Merton.</speaker>
      <p>I wish the Social Farmers and their dinner were at Jericho—my father insists upon my
       attending, he says its a mark of respect the squire's son owes to the "agricultural interest"
       of the neighbourhood, <stage>(loud hammering of tables and jingling of glasses heard
        R.)</stage> Halloa, the Social Farmers seem hard at it; I left home in such a hurry, that I
       quite forgot to read the letter that reached me just as I was starting, <stage>(producing
        letter from his pocket)</stage> Staunton's handwriting I declare ! <stage>(reading)</stage>
       "Dear Mark, The little village milliner is one too many for me—I leave <hi>you</hi> to try
        <hi>your</hi> luck. Vainly have I disguised myself, and assumed the speech and manners of a
       mechanic." <stage>(speaking somewhat angrily)</stage> The devil he has!
        <stage>(reading)</stage> "No go ! Hymen's fetters are the only chains she'll ever wear.
       Meanwhile my creditors are dunning so ferociously, that I have no more time for pastoral
       courtships, and am compelled to throw myself away on a girl with a slight squint and a snug
       fortune. Pity the sorrows of an improvident young man, and come and witness his "execution."
       Yours in deep dejection.—Paul Staunton."</p>

     <sp who="#L1188_M3">
      <speaker>Mert.</speaker>
      <p>So ! <stage>(musingly)</stage> Paul gives up the little village milliner does he? By Jove,
       that's worth knowing. I am neither so scrupulous nor so easily discouraged, and shall renew
       the pursuit with two-fold ardour. Bewitching little creature! she's worth all the squires
       daughters for miles round ! I can think of nothing else, <stage>(renewed hammering of tables
        R.)</stage> Halloa, the Social Farmers are waxing extra social. I must join them at once,
       and apologise for my tardy arrival.</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>exit L.—Characteristic music in orchestra.</stage>
     <stage>Enter at back, Jack Trudget—he is attired in a rough pea­jacket, a pouch is slung over
      his shoulder, he wears sailor's blue trousers, glazed hat with faded ribbon, &amp;c, carries a
      " peep-show " on his back; in his hand he has a stick—he appears tired and way-worn—a decided
      flavour of the "nautical" occasionally evinces itself in his attitudes and gestures.</stage>
     <sp who="#L1188_M1">
      <speaker>Trudget.</speaker>
      <stage>(looking round)</stage>
      <p>Well, I don't so much like the looks of this here "Rose and Crown" —strikes me it's a cut
       or two above my usual figure ; howsumever, my purfessiunal exertions ha' given me such a
       plaguey sharp appetite, I must have a snack o' summat som'w'eres, I don't
       <pb n="6"/>care whether it's on the tiles or in the coal-cellar! <stage>(pulls out coppers
        from his pocket and counts them)</stage> I ain't done a bad stroke o' business this
       morning—one-and-nine ! The worst o' these here country folks is, they're so plaguey fond o'
       the "hinstitooshun" that when they gets their heye ag'in the glass there ain't no
        <hi>indoocin'</hi> 'em to take it away ag'in they arn't got no notion o' the wally o' time
       in the prowinces ! Why only a minnit ago, a respectable father of a family, in a smock frock,
       had the imperence to ask if I couldn't let him and his wife, and his fourteen children have a
       peep for the combined sum of twopence- halfpenny—why, they'd ha' been a week over it! But now

      <p>The poor lady is asleep; her illness, though not dangerous, is a tedious and lingering one.
       Mr. Sands seems to take but little interest in his wife's distressing condition. He rarely
       visits her, and contents himself with coldly asking after the state of her health. Strange
