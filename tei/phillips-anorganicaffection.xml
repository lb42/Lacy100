<stage>(to Joliejambe)</stage>That young girl, whose humility excited your
ridicule, is the possessor of charms you never saw pourtrayed in your own glass,
Madam. Happy in her innocence, she was one night brutally insulted by some
things, in the guise of men. She struggled with her assailants, until one of
them, more courageous than the rest, struck her, and she fell bleeding and
insensible upon the pavement. I reached the spot in time to witness, not
prevent, the dastardly act. While I raised the bleeding victim, an humble friend
raised a mob; and between him and them her cowardly assailants were pretty well
pummelled. <stage>(takes snuff rapidly.)</stage></p>

<p>A capital subject for a domestic drama, Doctor. You, Mademoiselle, could play
the heroine. To be sure it would be a little out of your line, but then it would
be so interesting to have your eye put out, and make you tell your story in
broken English.</p>

nothing but scratch paper, and eat a solitary mutton chop. Never even dream of
the felicity of a supper, except on Saturdays, when I treat myself to two ounces

ham.</p>

that I may lounge on the sofas with my legs anywhere and everywhere, and that I
may indulge in the society of the most lovely creatures in existence—I feel here
<stage>(hand on heart)</stage> that I could drink port, burgundy, champagne,
