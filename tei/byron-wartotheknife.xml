    <head>BEFORE THE PARTY.</head>
    <stage>Scene.—An elegant Drawing Room, C., with open doors; doors, R. and L.</stage>
    <stage>Mrs. Harcourt discovered seated, reading, L.—Penson arranging furniture.</stage>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. Harcourt.</speaker>
     <p>That'll do, Penson. If you go on altering and arranging for ever, you will never make the
      rooms larger.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Well, ma'am, as a villa is but a villa, howsomever you arrange it—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Just so; then don't attempt impossibilities.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <stage> (coming down)</stage>
     <p>No, ma'am. Master's rather late: he's coming home in time for the party, I suppose,
      ma'am.?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>What an absurd question, Penson! Why shouldn't your master come home?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Beg pardon, ma'am; didn't mean any offence, I'm sure. Only master's been out so much lately
      that—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Penson, you forget yourself. Pray hold your tongue about matters that don't concern you: you
      should keep your place.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <stage> (aside)</stage>
     <p>Yes, I mean to do that, spite of everything.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Because I am more familiar with you than most mistresses, you should not presume. I
      certainly <emph>do</emph> talk a great deal to you, as I am—so much—so much—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>So much <emph>alone</emph>, ma'am.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not; I was not going to say that.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>I thought you were going to say that master being out so much, you naturally—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <stage> (rises and comes down, R.)</stage>
     <p>Once for all, Penson, do<emph> not </emph>refer to that again.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F8">
     <speaker>Penson.</speaker>
     <p>Seeing it's a sore point, ma'am, I'll be careful. What's that? I'm sure I hear the sound of
      a silk dress—an expensive silk, too. There's ten and sixpence a yard in every rustle.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0993_F6">
     <speaker>Mrs. H.</speaker>
     <p>Oh! it's Mrs. Delacour; she said she'd come early.</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Delacour! Now, I declare if you call me by that odious name, I'll go away home this
      minute; you are perfectly well aware I was christened Emily, and why you should be continually
      reminding me of the great misfortune of my life, I can't divine.</p>
    </sp>

    <sp who="#L0993_F7">
     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>Yes, dear; leaving me a widow,—nothing more. Luckily, my property being settled on myself,
      he couldn't touch it. Ah! my dear, Time having softened the resentment I once bore him, I can
      now content myself by saying he was a  sad brute!</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. D.</speaker>
     <p>I can't play the hypocrite, dear. I was forced, a mere child, to marry him, and he tried his
      best to break my heart; but he didn't do it, dear—ha, ha, ha! Oh, dear no! It's wonderful what
      a deal hearts will endure—after marriage. It's rather odd your husband hasn't come in, isn't
      it?</p>

      Society seems to fling aside its conventional reserve, and people revel for a short season in
      being natural. Folks get quite friendly and familiar until they come back to town with its

      thief; if I order a grand supper from a confectioner's, and can't pay for it when the bill
      comes in, I'm a victim to pecuniary pressure. It's a longer phrase; but it don't express much

      at once. Now the whole business is explained, there's little enough in it. The fellow's a
