      <p>Right, Tommy; come, take a drink with us. See, here are two pots, one full and t'other

      <p>Right you are, Nick. He's as deep as a well, though folks say he's watery-headed. But he'd
       be just the chap for us. Whenever we cracked a crib, we could shove him forward, you know, to
       face the danger. If he succeeded, all right; we collars the swag. If he got took, we cuts,
       and leaves him in the lurch, and he would be all right, for no judge or jury would hang a
       idiot, you know. <stage>(TOMMY has been catching flies, but listening all the

      <p>Why, don't you see—Mary lives in a great nobleman's family. Bob could visit her of course,
       and contrive to hide in the house, and let us in at night, which would save us all the
       trouble and danger of forcing locks and bolts.</p>
