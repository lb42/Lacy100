<head>Preface .</head>
<p>It is related of Charles Ii., that, being present at a meeting of the Royal
Society, he very gravely requested to know the reason "Why the insertion of a
fish of three pounds weight, into a bucket of water, made no difference in the
weight of the bucket?" A vast quantity of learning and ingenuity was immediately
put in requisition to account for the phenomenon; at length, one gentleman
observed that, before they endeavoured to ascertain the reason, they should
establish the fact, and that, with submission to his majesty, he believed that
the insertion of the fish would make a difference in the weight of the bucket.
"You are quite right," said Charles, "it would."</p>
<p>The exceeding favour which has been shown to this Drama, by nearly the whole
of the Metropolitan Press, flatters me into the belief that the verdict wou'd
have been unanimous if the two or three dissentients, before they discussed the
merits of the piece, as a burlesque, had ascertained that it was a burlesque. </p>
<p>It has never been advertised or officially entitled "a burlesque." It is an
humble attempt to imitate or paraphrase (but not burlesque or travesty) such
portions of the Comedy of "the Birds,"as were capable of being adapted to local
and recent circumstances. To new set the teeth of the old saws, and make them
cut through "modern instances." "An experiment,"(as it is called in the bills)
undertaken with the view of ascertaining how far the theatrical public would be
willing to receive a higher class of entertainment than the modern Extravaganza
of the English stage, or the "Revue" of the French. To open a field—not for
myself alone - but in which much abler men might give the reins to their
imagination and their wit in a dramatic form, unfettered by the rules and
conventionalities of a regular Comedy, and assisted to any extent by Music and
Decoration. Notwithstanding the probable disappointment of the lovers of mere
absurdity, and the natural mystification of a few good humoured holyday
spectators, the experiment, I am happy to say, was as successful as my poor
abilities could make it, and, what is of more consequence, it ensures the future
triumphs of superior writers, if such will make the trial. The kind and
complimentary manner in which, even my censors, have expressed their opinions,
demands my best acknowledgements, and if I do not bow to their decision, it is
because, as I have stated, I deny the fact upon which they found their
arguments. One Critic, for instance, who insists on comparing "The Golden
Fleece,"a burlesque of a tragic subject with "The Birds," a paraphrase of
portions of a comic one, is shocked at the introduction of Jupiter, and remarks
that his language "was far too earnest; too literal; it was no longer burlesque;
it was no less than the voice of offended Heaven." My only answer is that I
nsver contemplated burlesque. The fable is ended; the allegory over; the moral
to be drawn, however trite, is a serious one, I could not too earnestly, too
literally point out (the sole aim of the piece).</p>
<l>What dire confusion in the world 'twould breed, </l>
<l>If fools could follow whither knaves would lead.</l>
<p>And it is the feebleness, and not the strength or gravity that I regret, of
the language in which the concluding exhortation is couched :</p>
<l>"On wings forbidden, seek no idle Fame,</l>
<l>Let men Be men ! and Worthy Of The Name !"</l>

<sp who="#L0287_F12">
<speaker>Cho.</speaker>
<l>From ancient Athens, upon Fancy's wing</l>
<l>To modern Babylon, these scenes we bring;</l>
<l>Their import, merely guessed at in the Greek,</l>
<l>We venture in our vulgar tongue to speak ;</l>
<l>With sundry variations I acknowledge,</l>
<l>Which may astonish men just fresh from college,</l>
<l>But to the million, prove less caviare,</l>
<l>Than if we stuck to Bekker, Brunck, or Carey:</l>
<l>In fine, we hope, by mimic means, and choral,</l>
<l>To draw from ancient saws a modern moral,</l>
<l>The truth of which may serve our piece to save,</l>
<l>E'en, if for Easter, thought a shade too grave ;</l>
<l>Not that with gravity we mean to teaze you,</l>
<l>Our birds have merry thoughts, we hope will please you.</l>
<l>The centre of their gravity is mirth, </l>
<l>Which if they lose they tumble flat to earth;</l>
<l>With cheerful song they'd wile an hour away</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>I act the nightingale, I beg to say,</l>
<l>Behind the scenes; but, when before your faces, </l>
<l>I venture out to speak the parabasis, </l>
<l>I come as now, in <hi>propria persona</hi>. </l>
<l>A sight, the author swears, worth all the money ; </l>
<l>For bless the men, they can be so gallant,</l>
<l>When a poor woman's services they want, </l>
<l>And thus much he entreated me to say, </l>
<l>By way of introduction to his play.</l>
<l>From Fairy Land awhile he has flown off, and he's </l>
<l>Trying to catch the Birds of Aristophanes</l>
<l>For your diversion. If, alas! he fails </l>
<l>In putting attic salt upon their tails, </l>
<l>He knows against him will be turned the laugh, </l>
<l>For you are not birds to be caught with chaff, </l>
<l>So hear him patiently before you frown, </l>
<l>Nor let his first shot bring the "Big Bird"down.</l>
<stage>Air—-"Should he Upbraid."</stage>
<l>Do not upbraid, kind friends, though I should fail</l>
<l>To sing as sweetly as the nightingale :</l>
<l>Critics be mute—nor scare the birds you view, </l>
<l>Or I shall have a crow to pluck with you!</l>
<l>Say some must frown—I hope the mass will smile, </l>
<l>Nor, for foul play, our playful fowl revile.</l>
<stage>Enter Jackanoxides and Tomostyleserom, following a Raven and a Magpie. </stage>
<l>Now to begin,—two citizens are these</l>
<l>Of—we'll say—any town, in short, you please, </l>
<l>Who, being discontented with their station, </l>
<l>As people may be found in every nation, </l>
<l>Seek from the sovereign of the Birds to know</l>
<l>Where for the better, they had best to go.</l>
<l>The rest, in their own words, they will make plain, </l>
<l>If not, the Birds I'll cut, and come again !</l>
<stage>Exit L.</stage>
