<div type="scene">
<stage>Scene— A well-furnished Sitting Room in Mrs. Bouncer's House; door, 2
E.L., to Box's chamber; general entrance door, 3 E.L.; door, 2 E.L., to Cox's
chamber ; fireplace and chimney glass , 3 E.L.; two practicable windows, looking
on street, R. and L. C. flat ; a table with cloth, cups and saucers, &amp; c,
laid for breakfast; a side table between the doors on L.  Cox is heard in R.
chamber, calling loudly, "Mrs. Bouncer! Mrs. Bouncer !"</stage>
<stage> Enter Cox, 3 E. L.— he is without his coat, and is partly shaved; he has
a looking-glass in one hand, and razor in the other. </stage>
<sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> No bell in the room, and nobody to answer my energetic vociferations!
<stage>( calls)</stage> Mrs. Bouncer!— <stage>(sees a bell on
table)</stage> Hah ! here's a bell, <stage>(rings, and calls
loudly)</stage> Mrs. Bouncer ! <stage>(till Mrs. Bouncer enters, 3 E.
L.)</stage></p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. Boun.</speaker>
<p> Bless me, Mr. Cox, what <hi>is</hi> the matter ?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Matter, Mrs. Bouncer! Look here, ma'am, and tell me how you expect me to
perform the delicate operation of shaving in a glass, whose reflective powers
are distorted to such a degree, that I can't be certain whether I'm scraping my
chin or cutting off my nose.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. Boun.</speaker>
<p> Dear me! I'm really very sorry—I'll see if I can find you a better one,
sir.</p>
<stage> Takes glass and exit hastily, 3 E. L.</stage>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Do so, Mrs. Bouncer— <stage>(retiring towards room, R .)</stage>— by the
bye, Mrs. B.— <stage>(perceives that she is gone — rings the bell violently, and
calls)</stage> Mrs. Bouncer, Mrs. Bouncer!</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. Boun.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(re-entering)</stage> What is it, sir?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> I merely wished to ask you if the cabman has brought back my umbrella that I
forgot in his cab last night—a brown gingham umbrella—with brass spike, and two
broken ribs ?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. Boun.</speaker>
<p> No, sir, I have heard nothing about it.</p>

<stage>Exit,1 3 E.</stage>

</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Well, that is rather extraordinary. Ah! By-the-bye, here's a glass here that
I can finish my shaving by. <stage>(goes to chimney glass ,and is shaving when
Box enters at door , 2 E. L.— he appears as if risen hastily from bed, and wears
a dressing gown, slippers, and night cap.)</stage>
</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(L.)</stage> What ringing and hollowing is this? Do you know, sir, that
you have disturbed me out of my first sleep? <stage>(Cox starts and appears as
if he had cut himself with razor)</stage>
</p><pb n="4"/>

</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> If it was your last sleep, sir, I should have done just the same—It's nine
o'clock, and I've been out of bed these four hours.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Sir, I believe you capable of any absurdity.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> I can't, from habit, sleep in the morning, sir.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Nor I, from custom, can't sleep at night, sir.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Then, sir, it's my unbiassed opinion——<stage>(turns and recognises
Box)</stage> Good gracious, Box !</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Heavenly powers! Cox!</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> My valued friend! </p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> My worthy chum ! <stage>(together)</stage>
</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Don't it strike you, Box, as rather remarkable that we should meet here
accidentally, as I may say, in our old lodgings after two years' Reparation.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Well, so it does. Are you still implicated in the hat manufacture, Cox ?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Without meaning any disrespect to you, Box—I say, advisedly—damn the hat
manufacture. I've retired from business.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Indeed; how very odd that I should also have seceded from the printing
profession.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Listen, Box. When, by a concatenation of small debts, duly recorded in the
archives of the Islington County Court, I was compelled to emigrate
surreptitiously from Mrs. Bouncer's apartments to the Old Kent Road, you can't
imagine my distress.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(l. c.)</stage> Yes, I can, by my own.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(R. C.)</stage> I tried to forget everything in the world.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Especially your share of the rent, which I had to pay Mrs. Bouncer.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Generous Box! don't mention it. <stage>(shakes Box's hand)</stage> Well soon
after, I was surprised, and I may add delighted, by the death of an old uncle,
who left me a comfortable annuity.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> How singular that my aunt of venerable memory should have died about the
same time, and left me a pretty little property.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> I congratulate you my dear fellow.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> I wish you joy of your luck. <stage>(together)</stage>
</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Well my next step was to get married; </p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Ha! ha! ha! ha! Do you know I've been guilty of the same indiscretion myself
?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> I was connubialised this day, twelve months.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> The very day that witnessed the loss of my liberty.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> But that's not all,—could you believe it, I have a child ?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Give me your hand, Cox. <stage>(he grasps Cox's hand)</stage> I also am a
man and a father!</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> How strangely things come about! Well, I've just returned to town from
Margate, where I served my first year—we arrived last night by the steamer; </p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> And I've come by train from Southampton.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> And finding that Mrs. Bouncer had apartments unoccupied, we popped into
them.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Precisely as <hi>`</hi> did.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Then your wife is here ?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Yes,—she's in there— <stage>(points to door, L .)</stage> And yours?</p>
<pb n="5"/>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(points to door, R .)</stage> In there.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(solemnly)</stage> Cox,—the wonderful sympathy that exists between us,
convinces me that nature intended us for Siamese twins.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Or Corsican brothers at least. <stage>(embrace)</stage>
</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> A thought strikes me, Cox, we should consecrate this day to friendship—by
breakfasting together.</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> With the ladies?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> With the ladies, of course. </p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M2">
<speaker>Cox.</speaker>
<p> Agreed. <stage>(rings table bell and calls)</stage> Mrs. Bouncer—Mrs
Bounce-e-e-e-r.—Bouncer don't exhibit her usual alacrity this morning. <stage>
Enter Mrs. Bouncer, 3.E. L., C arrying a tray with tea, Coffee, &amp; c.
</stage> Ah! Mrs . Bouncer,—breakfast--for four!</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. Boun.</speaker>
<p> There it is sir,—I thought as old friends you'd have it together.
<stage>(lays tray on side table, c.)</stage> There it is. Tea, coffee, shrimps,
muffins, eggs, fried bacon, mutton-chops, and watercresses, <stage>(puts
articles on table c. as she names them)</stage>
</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> That will do for the present, we'll ring when we require more .</p>

<stage> Exit Cox, R. 2 E.</stage>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> I've no doubt of it.</p>

<speaker>Mrs. B.</speaker>
<p>La, la, ra, la, la, &amp;c. Dear me, I'm frightfully out of voice this
morning: Is breakfast ready, Box?</p>
</sp><sp who="#L0113_M1">
<speaker>Box.</speaker>
<p> Yes, my dear, we only wait for my old friend, Cox, whom I met accidentally
here this moment—you've often heard me speak of him. We once lived together, and
now we are going to breakfast together. I'll just go and finish dressing, and be
back presently.</p>

been laid to order by some distressed hen, at twenty to the dozen.</p>
