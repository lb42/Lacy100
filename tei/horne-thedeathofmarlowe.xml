    <head> Dedication. </head>
    <p> This brief Tragedy, long since out of print, was originally published in London (by Messrs.
     Saunders and Otley), and was inscribed to the author's friend, Leigh Hunt, happily living at
     that time; and it is now Dedicated to his dear Memory—deservedly dear to all who knew him, and
     to a world of others who know his books.</p>

    <head> Opinions Of Literati On Mr. R. H. Horne'S Dramatic Genius. </head>
    <p> [The Publisher begs to state that, although all the following Opinions do not refer
     especially to the present Tragedy, he could greatly have added to the number with respect to
     this production.] </p>
    <p> It is a masterly specimen of the concentration of a world of life, passion, and sympathy. If
     the old Globe, or Blackfriars Theatre, could suddenly be raised out of the ground, with those
     who just remembered the days of Marlowe for spectators, this were a piece to fill up an hour
     for them, to the content of their stout and truly refined souls;—souls that minced no matters
     in which humanity was discernible. We have to thank Mr. Horne for a great honour done to us, by
     the inscription of the work to our name.—Leigh Hunt. </p>
    <p>In my humble opinion it contains the very salt of the Old Drama. I was delighted and
     surprised - Lord Lytton.</p>

    <p> Mr. Horne is unlucky not to have lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. His dramas then
     would have been acted; and they now might have been reprinted, with notes and illustrations. No
     critic, in that case, would have objected that his language was so like that of the old
     dramatists: the critic would only have admired.—W. J. Fox.</p>
    <p> There are finer things to be found in his writings than in any dramatist since the age of
     Elizabeth.—Robert Bell. </p>
    <p>No one after reading his Gregory Vii., will doubt Mr. R. H. Horne'S capacity for the loftiest
     description of dramatic writing.—John Forster. [Examiner.]</p>

    <p>Mr. R. H. Horne is a man of the most unquestionable genius.—G. H. Lewes. (Westminster Review,
     184.)</p>


    <p>Mr. R. H. Horne's noble dramas are not the mere wordy imitation of the elder dramatists, but
     kindred productions; inspired by a like vigorous and splendid imagination; alike guided by the
     instincts of a lofty genius ; at once penetrating and universal.—F. G. Tomlins' Brief View of
     the Drama. </p>
    <p> The Death of Marlowe haunted me long after reading it, as though the actual scene of passion
     had really taken place in my own room, before my own eyes. It has extraordinary
     power.—Elizabeth Barrett Browning. </p>
    <p>It is equally beautiful, dreadful, and pathetic. I read it through at a blow. Douglas
     Jerrold.</p>
    <p> It seems to me very much what Kit Marlowe himself might have written of the violent death of
     some other great and wayward genius, under similar circumstances, had the idea struck him.—Mary
     Russell Mitford. </p>
    <p> The Death of Marlowe is condensed to the utmost point. It is the very essence and
     sublimation of a tragedy; not a sketch or outline, be it observed, but the germ of gigantic
     nature. If lengthened, which it might be, all additions would ramify outwards from the vital
     spirit within.—The Author of Spirit of Modern Tragedy. </p>
    <p> There is fire in it: you must fight and wrestle as for life, till you get it purified into "
     fire of the stars." Fight and conquer.—Thomas Carlyle </p>
    <p> I had read it already, and with greater delight than any dramatic or other poetical work of
     the last twenty years.—Walter Savage Landor. </p>
    <p> If the stage shall fall to decay, I shall deplore it, if it be only for the sake of what we
     shall lose in Mr. R. H. Horne, and in the younger genius (1844) of Robert Browning—a genius
     only yet dimly perceived, but deeply felt. And I am not sanguine for the cause of dramatic
     authors unless a race of actors shall arise to help them.—Sir Thomas Talfourd. </p>
