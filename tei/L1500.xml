    <head>TO THE ELECTORS OF ........ </head>
    <head>GENTLEMEN,</head>
    <p>NEVER having been solicited to become a candidate, I have no hesitation in placing my
     services at your disposal. </p>
    <p>In the course of last Parliament NUMEROUS IMPORTANT QUESTIONS have occupied public attention.
     I can add with confidence they have NOT occupied mine. </p>
    <p>Regarding freedom from fiscal burdens, I have always advocated BEING PAID with liberality,
     and have questioned the RIGHTS OF OTHERS to oppress me with demands. I refer more particularly
     to the calls of those minions who, as representatives of power, are connected with THE TAXES,
     THE GAS, THE WATER, and THE COAL monopolies. I shall therefore give my cordial support to any
     measures calculated to ABOLISH the INCOME TAX. </p>
    <p>SCHEDULE D—VIC. I., CAP. 2, FOLIO 3, PAGE 4. I need scarcely add, that if ELECTED, I shall
     always be found at MY POST, ready to further my own interests. </p>
    <p>I shall have the opportunity given me every evening of addressing the Electors at the
      <hi>THEATRE ROYAL</hi> at 10-15, where I shall also be prepared to answer any questions put to
     me. </p>
    <p>Trusting to secure <hi>YOUR VOTE AND INTEREST</hi>, I have the the honour to be, Your
     obedient Servant, (Name of Low Comedian.)</p>

     <p>So this is the abode of Cincinnatus the Second, called from the plough to the throne ; and
      to think this ploughman holds in his hand my future happiness. Should he take a dislike to
      myself or Mr. Brothers, he could influence the whole of the tenants upon his newly acquired
      estates, and then farewell to everything. There is but one chance, at all risks, he must be
      secured before the opposite party knows anything about his sudden good fortune. Very queer—no
      one to take care of the house—perhaps unmarried! <stage>knocks on table with whip</stage>

      government, and I like it. Free and independents, plump for your only one. The Ballot Box
      Office open from eleven till four. Booking laws repealed. No bribery allowed, <hi>when found
