    <head>ADDRESS.</head>

    <p> “The success which attended the production of “King John,” last season at this theatre, has
     encouraged me to attempt another Shakesperian revival on the same scale. The very uncertain
     information, however, which we possess respecting the dress worn by the inhabitants of Scotland
     in the eleventh century, renders any attempt to present the tragedy of “Macbeth,” attired in
     the costume of that period, a task of very great difficulty. I hope, therefore, I may not be
     deemed presumptuous if I intrude a few words upon the subject, and endeavour to explain upon
     what authorities I have based my opinions, </p>
    <p> In the absence of any positive information handed down to us upon this point, I have
     borrowed materials from those nations to whom, Scotland was constantly opposed in war. The
     continual inroads of the Norsemen, and the invasion of Canute, in 1031, who, combining in his
     own person the sovereignty of England, Norway, and Denmark, was the most powerful monarch of
     his time, may have taught, at least, the higher classes, the necessity of adopting the superior
     weapons and better defensive armour of their enemies; for these reasons, I have introduced the
     tunic, mantle, cross gartering, and ringed byrne of the Danes and Anglo-Saxons, between whom it
     does not appear any very material difference existed ; retaining however, the peculiarity of
     “the striped and chequered garb," which seems to be generally admitted as belonging to the
     Scotch long anterior to the history of this play; together with the eagle feather in the
     helmet, which, according to Gaelic tradition, was the distinguishing mark of a chieftain. Party
     coloured woollens and cloths appear to have been commonly worn among the Celtic tribes from a
     very early period. </p>
    <p> Diodorus Siculus and Pliny allude to this peculiarity in their account of the dress of the
     Belgic Gauls; Strabo, Pliny, and Xiphilin, record the dress of Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, as
     being woven chequer-wise, of many colours, comprising purple, light and dark red, violet, and
     blue. </p>
    <p> We have every reason to believe, that the armour and weapons of the date of Macbeth were of
     rich workmanship. </p>
    <p> Harold Hardrada, King of Norway, is described by Snorre, as wearing in the battle with
     Harold II, King of England, a.d, 1066, a blue tunic, and a splendid helmet. The Norwegians not
     having expected a battle that day, are said to have been without their coats of mail. </p>
    <p> This mail appears to have been composed of iron rings or bosses, sewn upon cloth or leather,
     like that of the Anglo-Saxons. Thorlef, a young Icelandic, or Norwegian warrior of the tenth
     century, is mentioned in the Eyrbiggia Saga, as wearing a most beautiful dress, and that his
     arms and equipments were extremely splendid. </p>
    <p> The seals and monuments of the early kings and nobles of Scotland represent them as armed
     and attired in a style similar to their
     <pb n="5"/> Anglo-Norman contemporaries. Meyrick, in his celebrated work on ancient armour,
     gives a plate of Alexander I., who commenced his reign in 1107 (only fifty years after the
     death of Macbeth), and there we find him wearing a hauberk, as depicted in Saxon illuminations,
     over a tunic of red and blue cloth. </p>
    <p> The Earl of Huntingdon, who succeeded Alexander, under the title of David I., is represented
     on horseback in his seal, wearing a tunic to the knee, which C. H. Smith (one of our most
     distinguished authorities, to whom I am deeply indebted on this, as on all former occasions),
     in his work on the ancient costume of England, describes as being party coloured; in the same
     volume he gives the figure of a Scotch knight of the time of Edward I., 1306, who holds a spear
     of a leaf-shaped blade; on his head he wears a small skull- cap of steel, like some of the
     ancient Anglo-Saxon warriors of the eleventh century, and he is habited in a surcoat of cloth,
     descending to the knee, very much resembling a kind of tartan. Siward, Earl of Northumberland,
     and his son, who, with their followers, were despatched by King Edward the Confessor, to the
     aid of Malcolm, I have equipped in the leathern suits called Corium or Corietum, which were
     introduced among the Saxons in the ninth century, and are described as having been worn by Earl
     Harold’s soldiers in 1063, in his war with the Welsh. In the life of St. Colomba, written in
     Latin by Adomnan, one of his successors in the early part of the seventh century, and
     translated into English by Dr. John Smith, DD. in 1798, we are told that the monks at that time
     were clothed in the skins of beasts, though latterly they had woollen stuffs, manufactured by
     themselves; and linen, probably imported from the continent. The houses wore made of wicker, or
     wands, woven on stakes, which were afterwards plasterod with clay; and even the Abbey of Iona
     was built of the same rude materials </p>
    <p> Roderick, King of Strathclyde, is mentioned by Ducange sleeping on a feather bed about this
     date, so that even in those primitive ages luxuries were known among the great. </p>
    <p> In the four centuries and a half which intervened between the death of St. Colomba and the
     reign of Macbeth, it is reasonable to presume that considerable improvements took place among
     the Scotch, and that the fashion of their dress and buildings was borrowed from their more
     civilized neighbours. Under these considerations, the architecture, previous to tho Norman
     Conquest, has been adopted throughout the play. During the five centuries which preceded that
     event, the Anglo-Saxons made great advances, and erected many castles and churches of
     considerable importance; they excelled in iron work, and ornamented their buildings frequently
     with colour. On this subject I have availed myself of the valuable knowledge of George Godwin,
     Esq., F.R.S. of the Royal Institute of Architects, to whose suggestions I take this opportunity
     of acknowledging my obligation. </p>

   <div type="liminal">
    <p>The ample and lucid observations of Mr. Charles Kean upon the Costume and general appliances
     of Macbeth, as produced at his theatre, are so explicit and directly to the purpose, that any
     lengthened detail of the individual dresses worn may be dispensed with. It is impossible to
     refer to more valuable authorities than those named by Mr. Kean, and every spectator must bear
     testimony to the artistic spirit which combining research, discrimination, and accuracy in
     quotation and detail, has produced a truthful originality in dramatic effect not before
     witnessed upon the British stage.</p>
    <list type="costume">
     <item><label>Duncan.—</label>Long red gown, brown mantle embroidered at edge, fastened in front
      of throat, emall crown of gold; grey hair and beard ; royal staff. </item>

      buff leather shoes; steel helmet, with two eagle feathers in socket, in front; small circular
      shield of hide, strengthened and defended by bosses of brass of steel, when not in use
      suspended on the left aide by chain or strap from the girdle; party coloured mantle fastened
      with fibula on the right shoulder; spear, with flame-headed point. Second dress.—Red shirt;
      Blue mantle and leggings; black embroidered shoes, reaching to ankle ; gold turret shaped

     <item> The other dresses are merely modifications of the above, varying in colour, material,
      and quality, according to the rank of the individual, the style and character of the period
      being preserved throughout. The mantles and dresses display a variety of checquered and
      variegated colours. Some of the soldiers are attired in saffron shirts, with neck armour of
      rings or plates of brass, iron, or steel, and the conical skin cap, seen in the Bayeaux
      tapestry and other illuminations of the time. The arms are of steel and iron, the swords of
      medium length, broad at the hilt and tapering on both sides tothe point, the scabbards
      universally of leather or wood, spears, maces, hammers, double-headed axes of many shapes,
      slings and bows were also used; long hair, with moustache and beard, were generally worn. </item>
