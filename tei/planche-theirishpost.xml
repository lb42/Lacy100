<p>
<stage>(reading what he has just written.)</stage>"Gentlemen, be pleased to

would be pleased to pay anything! None of my ancestors, I'm sure—if I take after
them.</p>

<p>Faith, I'd like to see the gentleman who would be pleased to pay! I'd show
him for money, and make a fortune of him!</p>
</sp>

<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Hold your tongue, will you ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Sure, you're not the gentleman who would be pleased to pay, or you'd refund
the half-crown I lent you a month ago.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Hang your half-crown ! There, <stage>(flinging one to him.)</stage>take it,
do, and stop your eternal chatter. I shall never get these accounts right. How
on earth do you manage to write when you're talking to yourself all the time ?
You can't be thinking of what you're about.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>I am, and of a thousand things beside—I've a wonderful genius !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>For making mistakes.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Sure, I've a right to make 'em; ain't I an Irishman ? I stand up for my
national privileges !</p>
</sp>
<pb n="4"/>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>You abuse your privileges; no Irishman in the world ever made such blunders
as you do. You're eternally getting yourself, or somebody else, into scrapes by
them. What did you do yesterday ? I hear there was a crowd round you in
Cornhill.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>There was, but it was through you!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Through me !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Through you! every bit of it; I was standing at Birch's eating an oyster
patty, when I saw you scuttling along on the other side of the way; I called
after you, and you wouldn't hear me, so I made but one hop, step and a jump,
over the road, and coming slyly behind you, knocked your hat over your eyes
!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>What d'ye mean? I was at Islington all day, with the governor.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>So you were, for it wasn't you after all, but a fellow I'd never seen before
in all my life ! " Boh," says I; " Holloa," says he ; " what the devil do you
mean by that, sir?" "No offence in the world, sir," says I; "but I thought you
were my cousin George, sir, " says I, " the handsomest young man you'll see in a
summer's day, sir." "The Lord forgive me for lying," says I to myself; but I
couldn't say less to the gentleman, after breaking his hat, and the bridge of
his nose into the bargain.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>I should think not.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Sure, it was a mighty pretty compliment to pay such a Kangaroo as he was; but
that didn't satisfy him. " None of your blarney," says he ; " I'll bet you a
pound you didn't think any such thing." " Done," says I, " I've lost, and
there's the money." Faith, he took that easier than the compliment; so I had the
pleasure of wishing him good morning, and seeing him buy a new water-proof best
short nap, with my own sovereign.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Serve you right; I wonder he didn't have you up before the Lord Mayor.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Oh, faith, somebody began calling police in the first instance; but long life
to the boys, they're never to be seen when they're wanted.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Why, you knew well enough I had gone with my father to Islington. Were you
not left in care of the office, with all sorts of messages ?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="5"/>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>I was! but I just popped out for a lunch, and forgot all about it, at the
moment. By the bye, I forgot something else, too,—bad manners to me! What did
she say to you—you never told me ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Say to me! who ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Who ? why the girl you went to see at Islington, to be sure; Miss Mary
Capsicomb. Don't I know you went with the governor on purpose to pop the
question to her.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Pshaw! stuff!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Oh, as much stuff as you please—but you know it's true ; didn't you let me
into your confidence ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Let you in ? no—you broke into it!—opened my letter instead of your own.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>By the merest accident; and I apologised as soon as I'd read it ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Apologised—yes, before my father, and so let him into the secret.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>And didn't he approve of your attachment ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>By great good luck; but suppose he hadn't ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Oh, bother! what's the good of supposing disagreeable things that never
happened.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Well, at all events, Master Terence, you're the last person I should choose
for a confidant, and so you'll excuse me telling you anything about the
matter.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>You're wrong there, depend upon it—and you'll lose a great deal by it; for
I'm in love myself, and I'll leave you in blissful ignorance of the whole
beautiful story.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>With all my heart; but you'll be sure to blunder it out somehow or other.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>Oh, catch me making a blunder in love matters; I'm discreet enough in my
indiscretions.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">

<p>Here's the governor coming, you'd better finish the letters for the post.</p>

<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>So you're a pretty fellow, don't you think ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Me, Sir ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>No, not you, your cousin there, Master Terence; my plague! But there shall be
an end of it. I've looked <pb n="6"/>over a great deal on my sister's account;
but, unless you pay a little more attention, sir, back to Ireland you go, I'm
determined.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>What's the row, governor ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>Don't call me, governor, sir. I've told you forty times I don't choose to be
called governor ! It's a familiarity I don't approve of. I'm your uncle, sir,
unfortunately. I can't help that. My sister chose to throw herself away upon a
handsome Irishman, without a penny, and I have been saddled with you, sir, as
the natural consequence. I have tried to make a man of business of you, but it's
in vain; I must give it up, or you'll be the ruin of me?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>The ruin of you? Sure, you are joking, my dear sir; what would I be the ruin
of you for ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>Didn't I tell you yesterday, before I went out, to write to Mr. Hardup, and
tell him, if he didn't pay me the money he owed me, before twelve o'clock
to-day, I should instruct my attorney to commence proceedings ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>You did, and I did.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>You did no such thing, sir! Didn't I tell you at the same time to write to
Alderman Turtle, and acknowledge the receipt of £100 which he left here the day
before ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>You did; and I did, I tell you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>I did, and you didn't, I tell you. You sent the receipt to Hardup, and the
threat of proceedings to the Alderman, who is in such a rage, he will hear
neither apology or explanation. Swears I shall never dine in his house again. A
man who gives the best dinners in London; and to mend the matter, I've been
nearly smothered with blessings by that vagabond Hardup, who is running about
telling every body my noble and delicate conduct has saved him and his family
from utter ruin.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>And isn't that a proud consolation to you ? Sure, a poor man's blessing is
worth an alderman's dinner any day.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>Terence, do you wish me to knock you down, sir?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>That depends upon what's bid for me, sir. I'd be <pb n="7"/> a mighty great
bargain at the price you'd put me up at.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>You impudent rascal! Don't compel me to kick you out of my house.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>I will not, sir; I'll go as soon as you please, without the kick.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>George, what am I to do with this fellow ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>Forgive him this time, sir; he'll be more careful in future—won't you,
Terence ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>It's impossible to be more careful. I wrote the letters plain enough. It's
the confounded covers you've got the fashion of putting 'em in, that makes all
the mischief. They'd puzzle the Pope, they would!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, I'll forgive you once more; but mind, it's the last time; the next
blunder you make, back you go to Ireland; or, at least, you don't stay here. So
now sit down, sir, and write to Sheriff Capsicomb, that the Clapham and Tooting
Grand Junction are doing at three and a half, and that he had better sell whilst
he can.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M4">
<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>I will, sir.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M2">
<speaker>Lane.</speaker>
<p>When you have written it, post it directly. I promised to let him know this
morning. George will give you his address, and see if you can manage not to
mistake this time. I must run back and try what's to be done with the alderman.
To-morrow's a venison day at Fishmonger's Hall, and he's one of the wardens.</p>

<speaker>O'G.</speaker>
<p>I believe that my uncle would dine with the devil, provided he knew there'd
be venison. What's the address, George, of your father-in-law that is to be, Mr.
Sheriff Capsicomb ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0296_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>High Street, Islington ; but he's got a charming place at Norwood—gave £4,000
for it.</p>

and go to court, and give dinners to all the great people at the west-end. Well,
some people are lucky, that's all I say. I'm sure I should as soon have thought

<p>Just before my marriage, I went with my aunt to Ireland, on a visit to some
friends ; we had a horrid passage back to Bristol, and a young gentleman, on
board the steamer, was exceedingly attentive to me,</p>
</sp>

</sp>

<speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
<p>My dear soul, I was too ill to notice a feature of his face. I only know that
he lent me his cloak upon deck; forced me to drink some brandy and water, and
carried me below when I couldn't sit up any longer. I couldn't speak to thank
him, at the time, and I couldn't see him when I landed; Mr. Capsicomb was
waiting for me, with a fly, and I never thought to have set eyes upon the man
again.</p>
