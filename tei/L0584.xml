     <head>SCENE FIRST -- An Apartment in the Tower.</head>

     <stage>Enter the Duke of Gloster, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, and Sir William Catesby, R.</stage>


     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <stage>(C) </stage>
      <l>Thus far success attends upon our councils,</l>
      <l>And each event has answer'd to my wish;</l>
      <l>The queen and all her upstart race are quell'd;</l>
      <l>Dorset is banish'd, and her brother Rivers,</l>
      <l>Ere this, lies shorter by the head at Pomfret.</l>
      <l>The nobles have, with joint concurrence, nam'd me</l>
      <l>Protector of the realm: my brother's children,</l>
      <l>Young Edward and the little York, are lodg'd</l>
      <l>Here, safe within the Tower. How say you, sirs,</l>
      <l>Does not this business wear a lucky face?</l>
      <l>The sceptre and the golden wreath of royalty</l>
      <l>Seem hung within my reach.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M5">
      <speaker>Ratclif.</speaker>
      <stage>(R.C.)</stage>
      <l>Then take 'em to you,</l>
      <l>And wear them long and worthily: you are</l>
      <l>The last remaining male of princely York,</l>
      <l>(For Edward's boys, the state esteems not of 'em,)</l>
      <l>And therefore on your sov'reignty and rule</l>
      <l>The commonweal does her dependence make,</l>
      <l>And leans upon your highness' able hand.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M4">
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <stage> (L.C.)</stage>
      <l>And yet to-morrow does the council meet</l>
      <l>To fix a day for Edward's coronation.</l>
      <l>Who can expound this riddle?</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>That can I.</l>
      <l>Those lords are each one my approv'd good friends,</l>
      <pb n="4"/>
      <l>Of special trust and nearness to my bosom;</l>
      <l>And, howsoever busy they may seem,</l>
      <l>And diligent to bustle in the state,</l>
      <l>Their zeal goes on no further than we lead,</l>
      <l>And at our bidding stays.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M4">
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>Yet there is one,</l>
      <l>And he amongst the foremost in his power,</l>
      <l>Of whom I wish your highness were assur'd.</l>
      <l>For me, perhaps it is my nature's fault,</l>
      <l>I own I doubt of his inclining much.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>I guess the man at whom your words would point:</l>
      <l>Hastings—</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M4">
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>

     <sp who="#L0584_M4">
      <speaker>Cates.</speaker>
      <l>'Tis true, to you, as to the lord protector,</l>
      <l>And Gloster's duke, he bows with lowly service:</l>
      <l>But were he bid to cry, God save king Richard,</l>
      <l>Then tell me in what terms he would reply.</l>
      <l>Believe me, I have prov'd the man, and found him:</l>
      <l>I know he bears a most religious reverence</l>
      <l>To his dead master Edward's royal memory,</l>
      <l>And whither that may lead him, is most plain.</l>
      <l>Yet more—One of that stubborn sort he is,</l>
      <l>Who, if they once grow fond of an opinion,</l>
      <l>They call it honour, honesty, and faith,</l>
      <l>And sooner part with life than let it go.</l>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>And yet this tough, impracticable, heart,</l>
      <l>Is govern'd by a dainty-finger'd girl;</l>
      <l>Such flaws are found in the most worthy natures;</l>
      <l>A laughing, toying, wheedling, whimpering, she,</l>
      <l>Shall make him amble on a gossip's message,</l>
      <l>And take the distaff with a hand as patient</l>

      <l>I fear, he fails in his allegiance there;</l>
      <l>Or my intelligence is false, or else</l>
      <l>The dame has been too lavish of her feast,</l>

      <l>Once a bright star, that held her place on high:</l>
      <l>The first and fairest of our English dames,</l>
      <l>While royal Edward held the sov'reign rule.</l>
      <l>Now, sunk in grief and pining with despair,</l>
      <l>Her waning form no longer shall incite</l>
      <l>Envy in woman, or desire in man.</l>
      <l>She never sees the sun, but through her tears,</l>
      <l>And wakes to sigh the live-long night away.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Marry! the times are badly chang'd with her,</l>
      <l>From Edward's days to these. Then all was jollity,</l>
      <l>Feasting and mirth, light wantonness and laughter,</l>
      <l>Piping and playing, minstrelsy and masking;</l>
      <l>'Till life fled from us like an idle dream,</l>
      <l>A show of mummery without a meaning.</l>
      <l>My brother, rest and pardon to his soul,</l>
      <l>Is gone to his account; for this his minion,</l>
      <l>The revel-rout is done—But you were speaking</l>
      <l>Concerning her—I have been told, that you</l>
      <l>Are frequent in your visitation to her.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M2">
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>No further, my good lord, than friendly pity</l>
      <l>And tender-hearted charity allow.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Go to: I did not mean to chide you for it.</l>
      <l>For, sooth to say, I hold it noble in you</l>
      <l>To cherish the distress'd.—On with your tale.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M2">
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Thus it is, gracious sir, that certain officers,</l>
      <l>Using the warrant of your mighty name,</l>
      <l>With insolence unjust, and lawless power,</l>
      <l>Have seiz'd upon the lands, which late she held</l>
      <l>By grant, from her great master Edward's bounty.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M1">
      <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
      <l>Somewhat of this, but slightly, have I heard;</l>
      <l>And though some counsellors of forward zeal,</l>
      <pb n="6"/>
      <l>Some of most ceremonious sanctity</l>
      <l>And bearded wisdom, often have provok'd</l>
      <l>The hand of justice to fall heavy on her;</l>
      <l>Yet still, in kind compassion of her weakness,</l>
      <l>And tender memory of Edward's love,</l>
      <l>I have withheld the merciless stern law</l>
      <l>From doing outrage on her helpless beauty.</l>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0584_M2">
      <speaker>Hast.</speaker>
      <l>Good heav'n, who renders mercy back for mercy,</l>
      <l>With open-handed bounty shall repay you:</l>
      <l>This gentle deed shall fairly he set foremost,</l>
      <l>To screen the wild escapes of lawless passion,</l>
      <l>And the long train of frailties flesh is heir to.</l>

      <l>Thus far, the voice of pity pleaded only:</l>

      <l>And to ourself deliver up her griefs.</l>
      <l>She shall be heard with patience, and each wrong</l>
      <l>At full redress'd. But I have other news,</l>
      <l>Which much import us both; for still my fortunes</l>
      <l>Go hand in hand with yours: our common foes,</l>
