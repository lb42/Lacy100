<stage>Interior of a Village Inn in Alsace. Table and chairs, R.1 E.; L. an
old-fashioned sideboard, with curious china upon it, and glasses; door, R.;
door, L.; large window at back cut in scene, R.; large door at back cut in
scene, L. A candle or lamp burns upon the table; a stove at back, R., with
kettle on it; the pipe of stove going of through the wing at R. The country
covered with snow is seen through the window; snow is falling; a large clock in
L. corner, at back—hands to work. The Inn is the residence of the Burgomaster.
It is Christmas Eve. </stage>
<stage>Catherine (the Burgomaster's wife) discovered seated at a spinning wheel,
L. 1 E. Music upon rising of curtain. Hans passes window; enters through door at
back; he is covered with snow; he carries a gun, and a large game bag is slung
across his shoulders. </stage>

<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(taking of his hat and shaking away the snow)</stage> More snow, Madame
Mathias, more snow! <stage>(he places his gun by the stove)</stage>

<p> Still in the village, Hans? </p>

<p><stage>(R.)</stage>Yes, on Christmas Eve one may be forgiven some small
indulgence. </p>

<p>You know your sack of flour is ready for you at the mill? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes; but I am not in a hurry. Father Walter will take charge of it for me
in his cart. Now one glass of wine, madame, and then I'm off. <stage>(he sits at
table, R., laughing)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Father Walter still here? I thought he had left long ago. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>No, no. He is still at the Golden Fleece emptying his bottle. As I came
along, I saw his cart standing outside the grocer's, with the coffee, the
cinnamon, and the sugar, all covered with snow, he, he, he! He is a jolly old
fellow. Fond of good wine, and I don't blame him, you may be sure. We shall
leave together. </p>

<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>And you have no fear of being upset? </p>

<p>What does it matter? As I said before, on Christmas Eve one may be forgiven

<p>I will lend you a lanthorn when you go.<stage>(calling without mopving from

<stage>(from within, L.)</stage> Madame! </p>

<p>Some wine for Hans! </p>

<p><stage>(the same)</stage>Yes, madame. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>That's the sort. Considering the festive character of weather like this, one
really must take something. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but take care, our white wine is very strong. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Oh, never fear, madame! But, where is our Burgomaster? How is it he is not to
be seen? Is he ill? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>He went to Ribeauville five days ago. </p>
<stage>Enter Sozel, carrying a decanter of white wine and glass; she places it
on table, R.; she enters door, L. U. E. </stage>
<p>Here is the wine, Master Hans.<stage> (Exit So, L.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Good, good! <stage>(he pours out a glass, and drinks with gusto)</stage> I
wager, now, that the Burgomaster has gone to buy the wine for the wedding. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(laughing)</stage> Not at all improbable. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Only just now, when I was at the Golden Fleece, it was talked about publicly
that the pretty Annette, the daughter of the Burgomaster, and Christian, the
Quarter-master of Gendarmes, were going to be married! I could scarcely believe
my ears. Christian is certainly a brave man, and an honest man, and a handsome
man! I do not wish to maintain anything to the contrary. Our village is rather
distinguished in that respect. <stage>(pulls up his shirt collar)</stage>But he
has nothing but his pay to live upon, whilst Annette is the richest match in the
village. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Do you believe then, Hans, that money ought always to be the one
consideration? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>No, no, certainly not—on the contrary. Only, I thought that the Burgomaster——
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Well, you have been mistaken; Mathias did not even ask, 'What have you?' He
said at once, 'Let Annette give her free consent and I give mine.' </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>And did she give her free consent? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Yes; she loves Christian, and as we have no other thought but the happiness
of our child, we do not look for wealth! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Oh, if the Burgomaster consents and you consent and Annette consents, why, I
suppose I cannot refuse my consent either. Only, I may make this observation: I
think Christian a very lucky dog, and I wish I was in his place! </p>
<pb n="5"/>
<stage>Music. Enter Annette, L., she crosses and looks through window, then
turns to Hans </stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Annette.</speaker>
<p>Good evening, Hans! <stage>(Music ceases)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Ah, it is you. Good evening! Good evening! We were just talking about you!
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p><stage>(C.)</stage>About me! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Yes! <stage>(he takes off his game bag and hangs on back of chair, then
looking at Annette with admiration)</stage>Oh, oh! How smiling you look, and how
prettily dressed; one would almost think that you were going to a wedding. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you are always joking. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>No, no, I am not joking! I say what I think, that's all! That pretty cap, and
that pretty dress, and those pretty shoes were not put on for the pleasure of a
tough middle-aged forest-keeper like myself. It has been all arranged for
another—for another I say, and I know who that particular 'another' happens to
be—he, he, he! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(blushing)</stage> How can you talk such nonsense! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, it is nonsense to say that you are fascinating, merry, good and
pretty, no doubt; and it is nonsense to say that the particular another I refer
to—you know the one I mean—the tall one with the handsome moustaches, is a
fellow to be envied. Yes, it is nonsense to say it, for I for one do not envy
him at all—no, not at all! </p>
</sp>

<stage>Father Walter has passed the window, now opens door at back and puts his
head in. Annette turns to look at him. </stage>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Father Walter.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(laughing and coming in—he is covered with snow)</stage> Ah, she turned
her head! It's not he you expect! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Who, Father Walter? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! That's right. Up to the last minute she will pretend that she
knows nothing.<stage>(crosses to R.</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p><stage>(simply)</stage>I do not understand what you mean. </p>
</sp>
<stage>Walter and Hans both laugh. </stage>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>You are a couple of old fools! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(still laughing) </stage> You're not such an old fool as you look, are
you, Hans? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>No; and you don't look such an old fool as you are, do you, Walter? </p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Sozel with a lighted lanthorn, which she places upon the sideboard;
L., then exits. </stage>

<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>No. What is the meaning of that lanthorn? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Why, to act as a light for the cart. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>You can go by moonlight! (she opens the lanthorn an d blows out the
candle)</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; certainly we will go by the light of the <pb n="6"/> moon! Let us
empty a glass in honour of the young couple. <stage>(they fill glasses)</stage>
Here's to the health of Christian and Annette! </p>
<stage>(they drink—Hans taking a long time in drinking the contents of his
glass, and then hearing a deep sigh, and Music commences)</stage>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<stage>(seriously)</stage>
<p>And now listen, Annette; as I entered I saw Christian returning with two
gendarmes, and I am sure that in a quarter of an hour—— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Listen! <stage>(wind off)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>The wind is rising. I hope that Mathias is not now on the road! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>No, no, it is Christian! <stage>(Music, forte)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<stage>Christian passes the window, enters the door at back, covered with snow. </stage>
<sp who="#L1447_mult">
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<p> Christian! <stage>(Music ceases)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">

<p>Good evening, all. <stage>(Annette runs to him)</stage> Good evening,
Annette. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Where have you come from, Christian? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>From the Hôvald! From the Hôvald! What a snowstorm! I have seen many in
Auvergne or the Pyrenees, but never anything like this.<stage> (he sits by the
stove, and warms his hands. After hanging up his hat, Annette goes out and
returns with a jug of wine, which she places upon the stove) </stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<stage>(lighting his pipe and smoking, to Hans, who is also smoking)</stage>
<p>There, look at that! What care she takes of him! It would not be for us that
she would fetch the sugar and the cinnamon and warm the wine. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(laughing)</stage> Do not allow me, Annette, to be crushed by the satire
of Father Walter, who knows how to defy the wind and the snow by the side of a
good fire. I should like to see the figure he would present if he had been five
hours on duty as I have been in the snow on the Hôvald. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>You have been five hours in the snow, Christian! Your duties must be terribly
severe. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>How can it be helped? At two o'clock we received information that smugglers
had passed the river the previous night with tobacco and gunpowder; so we were
bound to be off at once. <stage>(Music - Annette pours out hot wine into glass
and hands it to Christian, C.))</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Drink this, Christian; it will warm you. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<stage>(standing, C.)</stage>
<p>Thank you, Annette. <stage>(takes glass - looks at her tenderly, and
drinks)</stage>Ah! that's good! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>The Quarter-master is not difficult to please. <stage>(Music ceases)</stage>

</sp>

<sp who="#L1447_F12">
<speaker>Cath.</speaker>
<p>Never mind. Christian, you are fortunate to have arrived this early.
<stage>(Wind heard off)</stage> Listen to the wind! I hope that Mathias will
have the prudence to stop for shelter somewhere on the road. <stage>(to Hans and
Walter)</stage> I was right, you see, in advising you to go; you would now have
been safely at home. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(laughing)</stage> Annette was the cause of our stopping. Why did she
blow out the lanthorn? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_F13">
<speaker>Ann.</speaker>
<p>Oh, you were glad enough to stop! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>Your winters are very severe here. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>Oh, not every year, Quarter-master! For fifteen years we have not had a
winter so severe as this. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>No—I do not remember to have seen so much snow since what is called 'The
Polish Jew's Winter'. In that year the Schnieberg was covered in the first days

<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p><stage>(at table, to Christian, in C., seated)</stage>I can tell you all
about this affair from the beginning to the end, since I saw it nearly all
myself. Curiously enough, it was this very day, just fifteen years ago, that I
was seated at this very table. There was Mathias, who sat there, and who had
only bought his mill just six months before; there was old John Roebec, who sat
there—they used to call him 'the Little Shoemaker'—and several others, who are
now sleeping under the turf—we shall all go there some day! Happy are those who
have nothing upon their conscience! We were just beginning a game of cards,
when, just as the old clock struck ten, the sound of horse bells was heard; a
sledge stopped before the door, and almost immediately afterwards a Polish Jew
entered. He was a well-made, vigorous man, between forty and fifty years of age.
I fancy I can see him even now entering at that door with his green cloak and
his fur cap, his large black beard and his great boots covered with hare skin.
He was a seed merchant. He said as he came in, 'Peace be with you!' Everybody
turned to look at him, and thought, 'Where has he come from? What does he
want?'<pb n="8"/> Because you must know that the Polish Jews who come to dispose
of seed do not arrive in this province till the month of February. Mathias said
to him, 'What can I do for you?' But the Jew, without replying, first opened his
cloak, and then unbuckled a girdle which he wore round his waist. This he threw
upon the table, and we all heard the ringing sound of the gold it contained.
Then he said, 'The snow is deep; the road difficult; put my horse in the stable.
In one hour I shall continue my journey.' After that he drank his wine without
speaking to anyone, and sat like a man depressed, and who is anxious about his
affairs. At eleven o'clock the Night Watchman came in. Everyone went his way,
and the Jew was left alone! </p>
<stage>Chord of Music—loud gust of wind—crash of glass off at L., —hurry. All

<p>But I do not yet see how I could have gained the cross in this affair—— </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M2">
<speaker>Walter.</speaker>
<p>Stop a minute. The next morning they found the Jew's horse dead under the
Bridge of Vechem, and a hundred yards further on, the green cloak and the fur
cap, deeply stained with blood. As to what became of the Jew himself has never
to this day been discovered. <stage>(Music ceases)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Everything that Walter has stated is strictly true. The gendarmes came here
the next morning, notwithstanding the snow; and, in fact, it is since that
dreadful time that the brigade has been established here. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Christian.</speaker>
<p>But was no inquiry instituted? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Inquiry! I should think there was. It was the former Quarter-master, Kelz,
who undertook the case. How he travelled about! What witnesses he badgered! What
clues he discovered! What information and reports were written! and how the coat
and the cap were analyzed, and examined by magistrates and doctors!—but it all
came to nothing! </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>But, surely, suspicion fell on someone. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M3">
<speaker>Hans.</speaker>
<p>Oh, of course, the gendarmes are never at a loss for suspicions in such
cases. But proofs are required. About that time, you see, there were two
brothers living in the village who had an old bear, with his ears all torn, two
big dogs, and a donkey, that they took about with them to the fairs, and made
the dogs bait the bear. This brought them a <pb n="9"/> great deal of money; and
they lived a rollicking, dissipated life. When the Jew disappeared, they
happened to be at Vechem; suspicions fastened upon them, and the report was that
they had caused the Jew to be eaten by the dogs and the bear, and that they only
refrained from swallowing the cloak and cap because they had had enough. They
were arrested, and it would have gone hard with the poor devils, but Mathias
interested himself in their case, and they were discharged, after being in
prison fifteen months. That was the specimen of suspicion of the case. </p>

Would anyone believe that the mere talk about the Jew could bring on such a fit?
Fortunately the people about here are such idiots they suspect nothing.
<stage>(seats himself in chair by table)</stage> But it was that Parisian fellow
at the fair who was the real cause of all. The rascal had really made me
nervous. When he wanted to send me to sleep as well as the others, I said to
myself, 'Stop, stop, Mathias—this sending you to sleep may be an invention of
the devil, you might relate certain incidents in your past life! You must be
cleverer than that, Mathias; you mustn't run your neck into a halter, you must
be cleverer than that—ah! you must be cleverer than that.' <stage>(starting up

<p>I am sure of it. There are so many ways of detecting criminals, and so few

<sp who="#L1447_M1">
<speaker>Math.</speaker>
<p>I quite agree with you, Christian; and what you say shows your good sense.
When a man has committed a crime, and by it gained money, he becomes like a
gambler, and tries his second and his third throw. I should think it requires a
great amount of courage to resist the first success in crime. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">

<p>You are right, but what is most remarkable to me in the case is this, that no

<speaker>Math.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(rising)</stage> No, no! What is your idea? </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M4">
<speaker>Chris.</speaker>
<p>Well, I find at that time there were a great many lime-kilns in the
neighbourhood of Vechem. Now it is my idea that the murderer, to destroy all
traces of his crime, threw the body of the Jew into one of these kilns. Old
Kelz, my predecessor, evidently never thought of that. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1447_M1">
<speaker>Math.</speaker>
<p>Very likely—very likely. Do you know that idea never occurred to me? You are
the first who ever suggested it. </p>

gold, quite full. Be quick, Mathias, be quick! Carry him away. <stage>(he bends
low down and appears to lift the body upon his back; then he walks across stage,
his body bent, his steps slow, as a man who carries a heavy load)</stage>

<p><stage> (after consulting the other Judges, rises, speaks in a solemn tone of

between midnight and one o'clock, Mathias committed the crime of assassination
upon the person of one Koveski, and considering that this crime was committed
under circumstances which aggravate its enormity such as premeditation, and for
the purpose of highway robbery, the Court condemns the said Mathias to be hanged
by the neck until he is dead! </p>
</sp>

<stage> Mathias staggers and falls on his knees. The Crowd makes a movement of
terror—the death-knell tolls—lights lowered gradually—then curtain at back of
gauze descends, disclosing the Scene as at commencement—lights up. Music—a peal
of joy bells heard ringing. </stage>

<stage> Mathias appears from the alcove—he is dressed in the same clothes as
when he retired into the alcove at the commencement of the Scene, but his face
is haggard, and ghastly pale—he comes out, his eyes fixed, his arms extended—as
he rushes forward with uncertain steps, the Crowd fall back with horror, and
form groups of consternation, with a general exclamation of terror. </stage>

<speaker>Math.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(in a voice of strangulation)</stage> The rope! the rope! Cut the rope! </p>
<stage>he falls suddenly, and is caught in the arms of Hans and Walter, who
carry him to the chair —the Bells heard off — Music, the melody played in the
Second Act when promise given — his hands clutch at his throat as if to remove
something that strangles him—he looks pitifully round as if trying to recognise
those about him, and then his head falls on his breast— Catherine, kneeling,
places her hand on Mathias heart. </stage>
