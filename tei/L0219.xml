   <stage type="setting"> Scene.—Interior of the Lowther Arcade. The Strand Entrance supposed to be
    at L. side; shops and stalls with goods exposed running across at back of stage; Pedestrians,
    male and female children walking to and fro at L., a number of people standing, others make
    their way in with umbrellas up, which they put down and join the Promenaders; the Beadle of the
    arcade occasionally seen; heavy rain heard. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(without, l.)</stage> Now, gentlemen, stand aside—don’t quite block up the way if you
     please! <stage>(forces her way through crowd, l., followed by Fanny; they have their parasols
      up, which they immediately put down)</stage> Mercy on us! here’s a day! this is something like
     rain. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(l.)</stage> Yes, mamma, very like it indeed. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. Jellicoe.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(r.)</stage> However, now we are safe under cover, my dear, suppose we see what we’ve
     got to do to-day. First, there’s the upholsterer’s; then the milliner’s; then the jeweller’s;
     then the printer’s—— </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>The printer’s—what for? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> What for! why, to order the wedding cards to be sure! </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>Lor, mamma! </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(imitating)</stage> Lor, mamma! just as if you’re not ready to jump out of your wits for
     joy all the time! I’m sure when I was engaged to your papa, I was so happy, I did nothing but
     cry all day long for weeks together: but, perhaps I was more in love with the late lamented
     Jellicoe, than you are with Mr. O’Walker? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>I like Mr. O’Walker very well, mamma; he’s agreeable enough—very amusing—very
     attentive—sufficiently good-looking—— </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> And very genteel! And then, he’s very well to do in the world; in short, Fanny, it’s a very
     desirable match for you in every respect; and if we can only persuade cousin Brown to be of the
     same opinion—— </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>Surely, mamma, I can get married without the consent of this cousin Brown that you are always
     talking about? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> Of course you can, my dear; but Barbican Brown is a rich old bachelor, and your godfather
     into the bargain—I shall never forget him on the memorable occasion of your christening—the
     tender yet half-reproachful tone in which he said “don’t kick up such a row, you little brat,”
     as you lay squalling in his arms;
     <pb n="4"/> and I must say, my dear, you did misbehave yourself in a variety of ways. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>Well, this godpapa of mine certainly must have taken a very violent interest in me indeed,
     considering that he has never seen me since. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> Simply because your poor papa went out of business shortly after and settled at Brentford,
     and cousin Barbican went into business and settled in London; we really must go over to his
     little place at Holloway this evening, we shall be sure to catch him at home, and then we’ll
     see if between us we can’t coax him to come down with something handsome on your wedding day.
      <stage>(violent rain heard)</stage> Dear, dear, I declare it rains harder than ever; I really
     think, Fanny, we had better put off our shopping and our intended visit to cousin Barbican till
     to-morrow, and get into a Brentford omnibus and go home at once. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F6">
    <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
    <p>Very well, mamma, but do let us take one stroll up and down the Arcade first. I suppose
     there’s no harm in it? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> Harm! Do you suppose I should be here if everything wasn’t perfectly respectable? For
     goodness’ sake put that silly notion out of your head—and take care of your pockets. </p>
   </sp>

   <stage> Mrs. Jellicoe and Fanny lounge out at R., looking at shops as they exeunt; violent rain
    again heard and noise of voices L., in dispute. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_U8">
    <speaker>Voice.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(outside)</stage> Now then—where are you pushing? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(without)</stage> I’m pushing my way into the Arcade—at least, I am trying to do it!
    </p>
   </sp>

   <stage type="entrance"> O’Walker, with a green cotton umbrella over his head, forces his way
    through Crowd, L. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Isn’t it a remarkable fact, that people no sooner get under cover out of the rain than they
     immediately congregate in a dense mass to prevent other people getting under cover out of the
     rain—I don’t know why they should, but they do! Here’s a day! never mind, I’ve no doubt the
     country wants rain, the turnips especially: somehow or other, turnips always seem to want
     rain—I don’t know why they should, but they do! and if they do, all I can say is, they’ve got
     it—consequently, it’s all for the best; and although my new twelve-and-ninepenny boots do feel
     for all the world like a couple of wet sponges, I think of the agricultural interest and am
     silent. </p>
   </sp>

   <stage type="entrance"> The Beadle here approaches, and touching his hat to O’Walker, points to
    his open umbrella, and then walks on. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(astonished)</stage> Now, that man evidently means something; he wouldn’t touch his
     hat to me for nothing—I don’t know why he shouldn’t, but he wouldn’t! </p>
   </sp>

   <stage type="entrance"> Beadle again approaches O’Walker, R., points to his open umbrella,
    smiles, touches his hat, and about to retire. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(beckons to him)</stage> My good friend, perhaps I ought to
     <pb n="5"/> know you? you may have been the cherished companion of my childhood, or the friend
     of my bosom in after years? if so, I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten you—now, what is it? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M4">
    <speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
    <p>Umbrella, sir! </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Well? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M4">
    <speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
    <p>Don’t rain here, sir—under cover, sir—needn’t keep it up, sir! </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(suddenly)</stage> Of course—ha! ha! ha! As you say, it doesn’t rain here—I don’t know
     why it shouldn’t, but it doesn’t! I’m obliged to you. <stage>(shutting up his umbrella)</stage>
     The fact is, I’ve so much to think of I really haven’t time to think of anything. In the first
     place, I’m going to be married—that’s a trifle to begin with, isn’t it? Are you married?
      <stage>(Beadle nods)</stage> And how do you like it? Is matrimony an article you approve of in
     the long run? In short—do you recommend it? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M4">
    <speaker>Beadle.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(in a low tone and with a significant wink)</stage> Try it! </p>
   </sp>

   <stage> Exit, L. </stage>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>He says “try it!” therefore, he does recommend it! Not that I exactly liked the tone in which
     he said “try it!” I mean to try it. I shouldn’t like to know who wouldn’t with such a charming
     little wife as I’m going to have, a sweet unsophisticated creature from the peaceful and
     picturesque village of Brentford, with health on her cheek, innocence in her heart, and £2,000
     in her pocket. Now that £2,000, added to what I shall bring, will make a total of £2,000; for I
     don’t mean to say a word about the ninety-seven pounds ten, left me last week by my uncle
     Samuel—no, that ninety-seven ten I consider the property of my creditors; I gave it yesterday
     morning to my friend Dibbs to invest in the three per cents, with the full determination of
     paying my debts with the interest. I made the calculation last night, and find that in
     thirty-seven years I shan’t owe one shilling in the world: if that isn’t a moral satisfaction
     for a man, I don’t know what is! Dear me! now I think of it, I went out in such a hurry this
     morning that I hadn’t time to read my letters. <stage>(taking letters out of his pocket and
      opening them)</stage> Oh, from Jacob Jones, Dibbs’ head clerk, to tell me he’s invested my
     ninety-seven ten, I suppose! Holloa—what’s this? <stage>(reads)</stage> “Sorry to say Dibbs is
     done up”— Dear me! how very sudden—poor Dibbs. <stage>(reading again)</stage> “and means to
     make a bolt of it to-morrow”— That’s to-day! well, I can’t blame Dibbs if he does; perhaps it’s
     the best thing Dibbs can do. <stage>(reads)</stage> “with all the money he can lay his hands
     on”— Of course, every man has a right to do what he likes with his own, and so has Dibbs.
      <stage>(reads)</stage> “all the money he can lay his hands on—yours included”— Mine! my
     ninety-seven ten! that scoundrel Dibbs! <stage>(reading again hurriedly)</stage> “he means to
     be off by the rail”— Jacob’s a clever fellow! <stage>(reads)</stage> “but I don’t know which”—
     Jacob’s an ass! <stage>(reads)</stage> “but this I do know, that if you want to get your money
     back”— Want my ninety-seven ten? Of course I do! “be at his house in Arabella Row, Pimlico,
     before three o’clock and you’ll nab him.” Before three o’clock— <stage>(hastily pulls
      <pb n="6"/> out watch)</stage> come, I’ve plenty of time, that’s one comfort—I’ll jump into a
     cab at once, drive to— Stop—I’ve only got a fourpenny-piece in my pocket, and I don’t suppose
     any cabman would take me two miles and a half for that—I have it, I’ll jump into a Pimlirow
     Omnibus—get down at the corner of Arabellaco, and come down upon Dibbs like a thunderbolt.
      <stage>(looking out)</stage> Ah! yes—there’s an omnibus! here! stop! conductor! </p>


    <stage> Puts up his umbrella and forces his way through Crowd at L.—and then heard outside. </stage>

    <p> Here! Pimlico! stop! stop! </p>

    <p> Full, of course; and, strange to say, there wasn’t a lady would get outside to accommodate
     me. They positively refused, every one of them—I don’t know why they should, but they did! </p>

    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Jellicoe! Miss Fanny, too! <stage>(passing his umbrella, which is still open, from one

     was indeed, my dear Mrs. Pimlico—I mean Jellicoe. <stage>(aside)</stage> That ruffian Dibbs!
      <stage>(aloud)</stage> And how’s my Arabella—I mean my Fanny? <stage>(aside, and looking at

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>No—I believe the only thing to be done is, what they do in Spain when it rains. </p>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> Ha, ha, ha!—you’re a funny creature! besides, as the old joke says, it suits the ducks. </p>

    <p>Don’t laugh, Miss Fanny; ducks are no joke I can tell you, and so you’ll find when the

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. J.</speaker>
    <p> Indeed! And what are you doing now? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Why the fact is, I’ve tried my hand at a good many things: I thought it prudent not to make
     too great a dash at starting, so I began by doing a trifle in the coal and potatoe line—then I
     took an early breakfast house—then I started a penny publication—— </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">

    <p> A weekly one? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, so weakly that it didn’t live above a fortnight. At last, I hit upon a brilliant

   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>By study, Mrs. Jellicoe—by intense study. I shut myself up in my room for three months, and
     the result of that confinement was a bolus. </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_F5">

    <p> And what do they cure? </p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0219_M1">
    <speaker>O’Walker.</speaker>
    <p>Everything—if you only take plenty of ’em! I used to make ’em up myself at starting, but so
     eagerly were they swallowed that now I’ve got three men and a boy up to their elbows in boluses
     all day long. Now, I’ll explain my system: these boluses are so composed that the more you take
     of ’em the worse you get—still you persevere—and when you’re as ill as you can be you leave ’em
     off, and from that moment you begin to get well; I don’t know why you should, but you do—that’s
     my system! But enough of business—now for pleasure. When is the happy day to be? Fanny, my fond

     a point of rewarding honesty—there’s half-a crown for you! <stage>(puts purse in his
      pocket—Beadle touches his hat, and retires)</stage> As I said before, I can’t help laughing;
     that poor innocent little Fanny, too, flattering herself she’s the only woman I ever loved. If
     she could only see a catalogue of my tender attachments, she’d find herself about the hundred
     and sixteenth on the list—that dear Patty Peckover, for instance. I do believe I should have
     married that Patty Peckover if she hadn’t had so many cousins in the Life Guards; but she was a
     good-hearted soul—she never would have treated me as Miss Amelia Jones has done. When I think
     of the number of cubas I’ve smoked in that woman’s little back parlour, and the bill I owe that
     woman for those cubas, that woman’s ingratitude quite shocks me! Here’s a letter she wrote me
     yesterday. <stage>(taking out letter and reading)</stage> “Perfidious monster”—that’s so like
     Amelia Jones, that is—“you’re going to be married, are you? Don’t deny it, hideous wretch that
     you are;” that’s Amelia Jones all over, that is—<stage>(reading)</stage>—“but I’ll be revenged:
     listen—I have kept your letters, miscreant!” that’s a favourite expression of Amelia Jones’s,
     that is—<stage>(reading)</stage>—“and to-morrow they shall be in the hands of your intended. So
     tremble, viper! and believe me to remain as usual—your fond and affectionate—Amelia.” Now any
     one would imagine that Amelia Jones was an exceedingly ill-used young woman—but it’s no such
     thing. I went to her shop in Little Windmill Street this evening, prepared to offer her a
     shilling a piece for my letters, she wasn’t at home—so I went into her little back parlour, and
     there, lying open upon the table, and staring me in the face, was
     <pb n="10"/> this letter <stage>(showing letter)</stage>—beginning with “Loveliest of Amelias,”
     and winding up with “Your fondest of Browns.” Now here’s a woman who’s got a Brown—a mysterious
     Brown—a Brown who by his own account is the “fondest of Browns,” and yet this woman presumes to
     call me a viper. Such is the sex—I grieve to say, but such is the sex. <stage>(during the above
      he has been occasionally cracking nuts, which he takes out of Mrs. Jellicoe’s reticule—very
      suddenly)</stage> Goodness gracious, I forgot Dibbs! <stage>(pulling out his watch)</stage> A
     quarter to two! Why it was a quarter to two the last time I looked. <stage>(holding the watch

     It’s a singular fact, but this morning I said to myself as I was dressing myself, “Barbican
     Brown,” said I, “thirty years’ experience tells you that as sure as you put on nankeens, so
     sure is it to rain;” nevertheless, nankeens I did put on—I sally out—before I get to the end of
     the street down comes a shower—nankeens soaked! I go into a pastrycook’s, call for a basin of
     soup, dry my nankeens at the fire, sally out again, down comes another shower—nankeens soaked
     again; go into another pastrycook’s, another basin of soup, another shower—nankeens soaked

     that I had lost my way, and seeing a gentleman in a Highland dress standing outside the door of
     a tobacconist’s shop, in the act of taking a pinch of snuff, I accosted him and civilly asked
     him where I was; he didn’t think proper to reply, which I inferred from being a Highlander he
     didn’t understand English—consequently, I entered the shop, and there I beheld a sweet
     creature—I bought a cigar, and though I had never smoked before in all my life, I lighted it—I positively
     <pb n="13"/> lighted it, and then I smoked and chatted, and chatted and smoked, till, as it was
     getting <emph>rather</emph> late, and <emph>I</emph> was getting very poorly, I took my leave
     of the fair creature and went home. I’m ashamed to say I was there again, the next day, and the
     next day, and the day after that; and as every pound of cigars I bought of her seemed to
     ingratiate me more and more in her good opinion, in less than a week I found I had laid in a
     sufficient stock to open a tobacconist’s shop of my own—in fact I became so fascinated—so
     charmed—so—so—— </p>

     recollect there is an establishment a few doors higher up, whose hospitable doors open every

     pay for their admission—I needn’t say, I mean the Theatre Royal, Adelphi! </p>
