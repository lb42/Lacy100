    <stage type="setting">Scene.—The Cottage of Marguerite D'Arbel in the Village of Castellan in
     the Lower Alps, on the French side of the Italian frontier. The Scene represents an Apartment
     on the ground floor of the cottage; door of entrance, L. flat, back; a large window, R. C.
     flat, through which is seen an Alpine landscape; projecting chimney, and hearth on which a wood
     fire is burning, L. 2 E.; a staircase leading to Marguerite's apartment, R. 3 E.; a cradle, L.,
     near the fire-place; a cupboard with large door to turn back, L. U. E.; rustic furniture; a
     heavy table, C.</stage>
    <stage>On the rising of the curtain, Ninon is discovered kneeling by the cradle, L., singing a
     little cradle song.</stage>

     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Ah, bless her heart! that long sleep has done her good. </p>
     <stage>(sings)</stage>
     <stage>Marguerite enters from her chamber at the head of the stairs, R., and descends while
      Ninon sings.</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marguerite.</speaker>
     <p>How kind of you, Ninon, to leave your work and come to help me, to-day, when I am so busy
      preparing for the return of my husband, whose ship has arrived at Marseilles. I expect my dear
      little Neomi's parents also; they are coming this morning to take this child. Is the darling
      awake yet? </p>
     <stage>(crosses to L. C.)</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; she has just opened her bright eyes, and looks beautiful as an angel.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>Sweet angel! It will pain my heart to part with one I love as dearly almost as my own
      child.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Neomi's parents are Jews—are they not?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; Jews from Marseilles, who on the death of a rich relative were compelled to make a
      sudden journey last autumn to Hamburgh, to take possession of the enormous wealth which had
      been bequeathed to them.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>And litle Neomi was left in your care?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>She was too young and fragile to bear the long journey, so I took charge of her, and have
      given her plenty of fresh air and goat's milk.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>You, and the air, and the goat have done your duty, <pb n="5"/> for the dear child is a
      picture of health. You'll be very lonely without her, but you have Claude to comfort you,  
      and keep you from grieving too much after little Neomi. Claude grows a fine boy.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>Yes; he's a dear little fellow. Do you know, although he has only turned six, he already
      speaks of going to sea with his father?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>I like the spirit of the child, and if I were you I'd let him follow his inclination. Who
      knows but some day he may rise to be an admiral or a boatswain. </p>
     <stage>(Hubert Malisset appears outside window at back, which is partly open)</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>I should like to see him choose some other profession than the sea.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Why, Marguerite, you married a sailor, yourself! Maurice D'Arbel is a good husband, and you
      are a happy woman.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>The wife of a sailor can never be happy; long absences and anxious looking for the loved
      one's return, make many blanks in her life. When Maurice left me to go this last voyage, I had
      a strange foreboding we should never meet again. </p>
     <stage>(crosses to R., up to chair)</stage>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>But he has returned safe, and your fears are over.</p>

     <stage> (perceiving Hubert's face at the window—screams, then grasping Ninon's arm)</stage>
     <p>There—look—that face! <stage>(Hubert disappears)</stage> A-ah!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <stage> (alarmed)</stage>
     <p>Where?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>'Tis gone! <stage>(sinks back nearly fainting)</stage> Twice already, within the last three
      days, have I beheld those features.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>You tremble, Marguerite—and your face is pale   as ashes, what has agitated you?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>Do not question me. <stage>(hiding her face in her hands)</stage> Yet why should I conceal
      from you a secret which is heavy at my heart. You are kind and affectionate and will pity me
      for the one fault of my life. Let me sit where my eyes may not be turned towards the window—I
      dare not look that way. <stage>(she sits, L. C., with her back towards the window, Ninon sits
       beside her, L. at her feet)</stage> Fifteen years ago—a regiment was quartered in the
      villages of this Commune; amongst the young soldiers was one who distinguished me by his
      attentions. At church he was ever by my side, and in our Sunday dances he was my constant
      partner. The preference of the handsome chasseur—for Hubert Malisset was then a good looking
      fellow—flattered my vanity—and in an evil hour, I consented to a private marriage with
      him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Ah! I never had such luck.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>A short time, however, revealed to me his real character. I found he was a man without
      principle or honour, <pb n="6"/> of depraved heart, and dissolute habits. In a fit of
      intoxication he struck an officer of his regiment, for which he was tried by Court Martial,
      and sentenced to be shot. The night preceding the day on which his execution was to take
      place, he escaped from prison and fled into the mountains, when he joined a gang of
      contrabandista; soon after, according to the dying confession of an associate, he was killed
      in a conflict with the custom   house officers on the frontier.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>A good riddance of such a fellow.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>It would be false to say I regretted him; so when Maurice D'Arbel, a few years later, made
      me an offer of marriage I accepted him.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Just what I'd have done myself had I been in your place. Of course you thought no more of
      the wretch from whom heaven had delivered you!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <stage> (agitated)</stage>
     <p>Hush, Ninon, hush! that face I saw at the—those eyes which have thrice met mine of late—if
      Hubert Mallisset be living—that face—those eyes are his.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F7">
     <speaker>Ninon.</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious—you frighten me. But I can't believe it, and I won't believe it.
       <stage>(Malisset shows his face at the window at back unperceived by the women)</stage> It's
      only a fancy of yours. An accidental likeness between some stranger and that honest man, who,
      thank heaven, can never trouble you more.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L1379_F6">
     <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
     <p>Well, I'll try and banish it from my mind. <stage>(Malisset disappears)</stage> Hark! My
      little Claude is awake. <stage>(both rise)</stage> I must hasten to dress him. </p>

      <p>   Hush! You have surprised my secret—but knowing so much, you shall know all. More than
       sixteen years ago a sudden stroke deprived me of reason, and for several months I lived in a

      <p>Yes, some years after, when my little Francisca was lying in fever at the point of death;

       wife; what a life she leads me about Pippa, the pretty sempstress who lives opposite our

       tears over a miniature which she carries in her bosom. One day I got a peep at it over her

      <p>Yes, I remember when I was a boy, I used to frequently walk in my sleep to a neighbouring

      <p>   Well, Madame Montalba is what they call a somnambulist, and when her mind is much
       disturbed, she comes at night like a spectre from her chamber, with those great dark eyes of
       hers wide open, though she is fast asleep; and then all the strange and terrible scenes of
       her life seem to pass through her brain, and are acted over again. Ah! the poor woman has
       suffered as you have never suffered. We take care though that Signora Francisca never sees
       her in this state, it would shock her so, but mark my words, this dreadful struggle will kill
