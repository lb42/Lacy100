   <stage>Scene. —A handsomely furnished drawing-room in an Irish country house—two magnificent
    Footmen laying luncheon.</stage>

    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> We needn't be too particular, Thomas. Missus is going to lunch alone, and she don't know how
     things ought to be done.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M10">
    <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
    <p> Of course she don't—she's a low person. Why, only yesterday she ordered cook to send up
     suety dumplings with the haunch of venison.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M9">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> What could you expect from a young 'oman brought up in an 'ovel—in an 'ovel, Thomas ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M10">
    <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
    <p> You're right, John, in a low 'ovel. I understand she was a Hirish peasant girl.</p>

   <sp who="#L0819_M9">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> For my part I shall look out for a new place at once.</p>

    <p> And so shall I, and to prevent the recurrence of this haccident, I shall put at the bottom

    </p>
    <p>Poor little Eily, I musn't be too hard with her. When a dashing, handsome, well educated
     young fellow like me marries a girl so much beneath him in station as I have done, he must be
     prepared to bear with a little want of good breeding now and then. I left the house in a huff
     this morning, because she would insist upon saying " spake" instead of " speak;" and I intended
     staying out all day, but I can't be deaf to the voice of love, whether it " speaks" or "
     spakes;" and the voice of love said, "Go back, Hardress Cregan, and make it up with your own
     Colleen Bawn, as you've done already fifty times in the
     <pb n="4"/>short period you've been married." Dear Eily ! she's a wife that any man might be
     proud of -- <stage>(Eily heard outside singing "the Cruiskeen Lawn ")</stage> At least she
     would be, if she wouldn't sing those confounded low songs.</p>
   </sp>
   <stage> Enter Eily in the original peasants dress, C. door. </stage>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, Hardress, mavourneen, an' is it come back to me ye have ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> "Is it come back to me?"—is that the way for a lady to express herself? <stage>(turning and
      seeing her dress)</stage> Eh ! what's this ? is that the way for a lady to dress herself, too
     ? Madam, in one word, what does this mean ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> What does what mane ?</p>

    <p> Can't you say " mean ?"</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Sure I did say "mane."</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Well, then, what do you <hi>{mane} </hi> by dressing in this low, ridiculous fashion?</p>

    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Mrs. Hardress Cregan, I'm not a cushla. And I beg you'll not call me by any of those
     ridiculous names again. Is this a costume fitted for my wife ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Well, Hardress, mavourneen —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Hardress Cregan is my name, if you please, madam.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Well, Hardress, dear, I've been trying ever so long to get used to them long clothes; but
     that thing like a big hen coop, barrin' it's made of wire like a rat trap, is always catching
     me about the ankles just as if I was a rat myself, or an otter—but I don't like it dear, indeed
     I don't. But I'll wear anything to please you, only you told me you had gone out for the day,
     and so I thought I would enjoy myself in the clothes I used to wear when you took a fancy to
     me, Hardress, mavour —I mean, my dear.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> I can't resist her coaxing ways. <stage>(to her)</stage> Well, well, don't let me see you in
     this dress again. So now let us go to lunch.<stage> (Hardress sits at, table, l.
     c.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, sure an' that's like yourself now. <stage>(sitting to table, L) </stage>What will you
     take, Hardress, dear, some mate, or some poy?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> "Mate!" "poy!"</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, sure, an' it isn't mate-poy ; it's a beautiful damson-tart, that I made with my own
     hands.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Eily, I tell you I object to my wife making tarts with her own hands.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, sure, an' I washed them first.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Washed them! Girl, you don't understand your position. Only yesterday you humiliated me
     before company by telling a story about your feeding the pigs.</p>
   </sp>
   <pb n="5"/>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> It was no story at all, at all—it was the blessed truth, which father Tom told me always to
     tell. I <emph>{was}</emph> feeding the pigs!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> And the other day I actually heard of your peeling the potatoes!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_F6">
    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, hark at that now—as if you didn't know that I did it to please you, Hardress dear; when,
     if I had consulted my own feelings, I would have had them with the jackets on.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0819_M1">
    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> Jackets! Let me tell you that potatoes don't wear jackets.</p>

    <p> Well, sure they wear overcoats anyhow !</p>

    <speaker>Eily.</speaker>

    <speaker>Hard.</speaker>
    <p> You'll break my heart! Your low-bred ignorance is disgracing me every day. But I see I must
     have patience with you, and undertake your education myself. There, take the newspaper and read
     to me.</p>

    <p> Ah, Hardress, my dear fellow— <stage>(knocks against chair)</stage> I beg your pardon,

      stool)</stage> I hope I haven't trod upon your toes. <stage>(seeing no one present)</stage>
     Why, there's nobody here. Then, why the devil do they leave furniture about the room ? Can't
     want chairs and things when there is nobody to sit down upon them. I—I—I knew a fellah who was
     a broker who had chairs and things about his room; but Hardress isn't a broker. I—I—I wan't to
     see Hardress. I—I've got a telegram I wan't him to read for me. I—I'm not much of a hand at
     reading telegrams myself. In fact, I—I never knew a fellah who could read telegrams.
     Wo-wonderful things those telegrams ! They tell me they come along those wire things. I
     wo-wonder how they p-pass the p-posts. However, that's the telegraph's own look out.
      <stage>(takes out letter and looks at it)</stage> I—I know a fellah who gets his daughter to
     read all his telegrams for him. I—I had a daughter myself once—if she were here, I daresay she
     could read this telegram for me. No, that's all nonsense, of course she couldn't read
     telegrams; for she was only a little baby when she was stolen by an old Irish nurse- but then
     she can't be a little baby now—she—she must be big enough to—to read anything—that is, if the
     Irish nurses teach the children that they steal to read. Oh, that's all nonsense. Can't expect
     Irish nurses to go to the expense of teaching other people's children to read. What the devil
     do the Irish nurses do with all the children that they steal ? Oh—oh that's one of the things
     that no fellah can make out. W-what's this ? <stage>(reading envelope)</stage> " Delivered
     free." Very cheap ; it beats the penny postage hollow. I wonder how they make it pay. Well,
     that's the telegraph fellah's own look out. <stage>(reading envelope again)</stage> "You are
     requested not to give any fee or gratuity to the messenger. " What do they tell me that for?
     I—I never meant to—to give
     <pb n="10"/>any fee or gratuity to the fellah's messenger; I—I—I'd see him damned first.
      <stage>(opening letter)</stage> It's from Cork. I—I don't know any fellah in Cork ; that is, I
     know there is a Cove at Cork, but I don't know him. I—I—I don't know why the Cove at Cork
     should telegraph to me—o-oh, he's mad. <stage>(turning over telegram)</stage> Why, one side of
     it is in print and the other side writing. H-how is a fellah to know which side he is to read
