    <p>This edition is not printed for circulation in the United States—the American copy is
     published by Mr. Wemyss, 575, Broadway, New York, and permission to perform it must be obtained
     of the author, Mr. A. Daly. To both these gentlemen, I offer a sincere expression of regret
     that I have at length allowed myself to follow the disreputable example of some New York and
     Boston publishers, and appropriate property to which I have, certainly, no moral right. I have
     for years wholly repudiated the practice of pilfering from Americans, and should never, at any
     time, have assumed what I consider to be a degrading, if not a dishonest position, had I not
     been the victim of hundreds of instances of similar delinquency from the other side of the
     Atlantic. The most annoying and injurious instance of this is the case of “The Amateur’s
     Guide,” which, in design and treatment, was altogether original. I knew such a publication was
     really wanted, and it occupied all the time I could spare for months in arrangement,
     compilation, and new matter. I anticipated that it would be stolen, but I did not expect that
     the gentleman who terms himself my agent in New York should hurriedly thrust a mutilated
     version of it on the American Public with a <hi>studious withholding of my name from the book
      altogether</hi>, and that my own Preface should be copied, and signed by Tony Denier <hi>as
      the author of the book.</hi>
     <note place="foot"> This is doubtless an assumed name, for no real personage would have placed
      himself in so shabby a light, and would have so deliberately gibbeted himself as he has done,
      by the shameless assertion that he is the Author or compiler of a work of which he did not
      write or compile a line,</note> Sympathising with the honest movement now agitating the public
     attention in America for a reciprocal protection — of literary property—I have taken this step
     to aid it, and deliberately — assert that had Mr. Daly possessed the right to introduce this
     drama into England and her Colonies—its merit is such that he might have hoped to derive an
     important pecuniary result therefrom for years—all which is sacrificed by the disinclination of
     the American Government to believe in the genius and inventive power of its own citizens, </p>

      <p>Business, on this happy day! I came for pleasure—to see Miss Courtland, my little
       pupil—grown so—only think, sir, I knew her when she was only a little child, I taught her
       music—she was so musical—and so beautiful—I adored her, and her mother told me I needn't come
       again. But I did, and her mother was glad to see me, wasn't she, little pupil? <stage>(to
        Laura, who is pale with terror, leaning on Pearl, R., Ray C., Byke L.)</stage> and begged me

      <p>One night father and mother were going to the opera. When they were crossing Broadway, the

      <p>Yes, but a thief hardly six years old, with a face like an angel's. “Stop!” said my mother,
       “what are you doing?” “Trying to steal,” said the child. “Don't you know that it's wicked to
       do so?” asked my father. “No,” said the girl, “but it's dreadful to be hungry.” “Who told you
       to steal?” asked my mother. “She—there!” said the child, pointing to a squalid woman in a
       doorway opposite, who fled suddenly down the street. “That is Old Judas,” said the girl.</p>

      <p>This child was Laura. My father was about to let her go unharmed, but my mother said, “No,
       it is not enough. We have a duty to perform, even to her,” and acting on a sudden impulse,
       took her to our home. On being questioned there, the child seemed to have no recollection
       save of misery and blows. My mother persuaded father, and the girl was sent to a country
       clergyman's for instruction, and there she remained for several years.</p>

       catechism. “What's to be done when you're hard up?—Steal! What's to be done if you're caught
       at it?—Kill!” It's short and easy, and he lives up to it like a good many Christians don't
       live up to their laws. <stage>(looking off L.)</stage> They're out of sight. Phew! it's

       he could never be called your lover, for he seems incapable of any passion but melancholy.”
       It's quite true,

       forgive me if I have been cross and cold. For the future, I will do my duty, as your

       Oh, dear! I begin to feel that he can love—but not me. Well, I'd just as soon break, if he'd
       be the first to speak. How sweet and fresh the air is. <stage>She turns down lamp.</stage>
