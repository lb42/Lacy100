    <p> Presently. <stage>(reads)</stage> "Heavy floods—bridge blown up— rapid retreats." Ah ! these
     electric telegraphs perform wonders for us in these days. Well, I hope the right may
     win—justice always before oppression; it is, and ever will remain my motto, without entering
     into politics—there's nothing like it. These hot-headed foreigners are always getting
     themselves into—</p>

     <stage>(laughs)</stage> Come, that's not bad, Jane; you've expressed my opinion to a T.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L059_F4">
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> I meant it for the tea, sir—it's weak. <stage>(bugle heard, L.</stage></p>

    <p> What's that?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L059_F4">
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> Soldiers, sir, come down from London, by the train. Miss Kate says they're to fight for the
     lion and unicorn, if wanted.</p>

   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> What does she know about it, pray ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L059_F4">
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> A great deal, sir—she reads the news, so do I—and my first cousin's in the militia, beats
     the big drum.</p>

    <speaker>John.</speaker>

   <sp who="#L059_F4">
    <speaker>Jane.</speaker>
    <p> If you please, sir, my next holiday out, you won't be angry if I go to hear the band play—my
     cousin's great on the drum, and when he twists the drum sticks in the air— oh, la!</p>

    <p> Go, with all my heart, Jane.</p>

    <p> Thank you, sir. <stage>(aside)</stage> Won't it be a treat!</p>
    <stage> Exit into house, with tray, R. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> Our heads are all turned more or less with this military fever. Our quiet town is turned
     upside down with it. Ah, wars like inoculation, it rapidly extends. Heaven keep us out of it,
     say I—peace and commerce are the natural bulwarks of Britain—not that we ever objected to a
     taste of war when forced on us—the blood of the old Sea Kings flows in our veins clear and
     strong as ever.</p>

    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> Out with it, man—never hesitate. Is it assistance you require ?—young men are very

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p> No, sir. Sir, your repeated acts of kindness to myself and mother can never be repaid.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> My good friend, all that I have done you deserve— your energy and strict attention to my
     interest more than repays any little obligation conferred ; so no more about that matter
     now—your business, what is it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p> You have a daughter, sir.</p>

    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> Allow me to differ with you slightly on that subject. But pray what has she done to entitle
     her to such lofty admiration on your part ?</p>

   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(abashed)</stage> Sir, I cannot reveal—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, I guess it, young man—the old—old story over again ! Love—admiration—moonshine ! I
     expected as much
     <pb n="5"/> from your last month's ledger—two erasures and a wrong invoice. My friend, Cupid
     never agreed with a ready reckoner —he was not intended for a tutor's assistant. Forget this
     visionary trifle—attend to vulgar fractions, and strive to keep a good account at the
     bankers—you'll find it more profitable.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p> Mr. Lawrence, I should ill repay the confidence you have been pleased to place in me, if I
     continue the indulgence of a hopeless passion without your approval. It is true that I love
     your daughter fervently and devotedly—but, sir, it is with honour.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> I believe you, on my word.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p> I am fully aware that the position I am placed in renders all chances of your consent
     futile—without it I will never seek to plunge one that I love more than life into penury and
     distress.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(aside)</stage> The right sort. What a pity he's made a fool of himself. Mr. Somerton,
     you speak as a man of honour should do. What are your ultimate intentions in this dilemma ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">
    <speaker>Somer.</speaker>
    <p> To quit your employ, sir, for ever, or to return so rich that my pretensions to Miss
     Lawrence's hand may not be totally disregarded.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> They never shall, young man— <stage>(shakes hands)</stage> that I promise while John
     Lawrence lives. I like honest, open conduct—it is the basis of everything—makes our names as
     Englishmen and merchants respected and trusted all over the world, but—</p>
    <stage>Kate peeps in from the house, L., comes down, c.</stage>
    <p>Are you assured the girl loves you in return ?</p>
    <stage>(Kate advances slowly laughing, R.</stage>

    <speaker>Kate.</speaker>
    <p>I rather think he is, papa.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> A very pretty confession to make to your father, miss.</p>

   <sp who="#L059_F3">
    <speaker>Kate.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage>(smiling)</stage> Open conduct, you know, papa, makes us respected all over the

    <p> Silence, miss—endeavour to take a lesson from Mr. Somerton's conduct.</p>

    <speaker>Kate.</speaker>
    <p> I have, dear papa, and hope my endeavours may be crowned with success.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> I don't doubt that for a moment. Perhaps you will leave us, as I am speaking to Mr. Somerton
     privately.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L059_F3">
    <speaker>Kate.</speaker>
    <p> How horribly selfish you are to-day, papa. Mind, I won't be shut up in a convent.

   <sp who="#L0599_M1">
    <speaker>John.</speaker>
    <p> Gipsy! It is but fair, having explained yourself to me, that I in return should do the same.
     The fortune that I have made was gained by daily labour, strict economy and prudence. Whoever
     marries my Kate, must have something towards
     <pb n="6"/>housekeeping; disinterested affection is a very pretty thing to talk or sing about.
     Love in a cottage—without a banker's book, too frequently ends in regrets and reproaches. Place
     your shoulder to the wheel of fortune, strive manfully, resolve to be rich, and you will be so,
     boy—go boldly into the world, return in ten years, and then we'll talk about matrimony.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0599_M2">

    <p> I bow to your decision, and will leave to-morrow.</p>
