   <stage>SCENE.—An elegant Apartment in a country hotel—opening upon gardens, tastefully
    arranged.</stage>
   <stage>Enter Waiter, showing in Sir Marmaduke, R.H.</stage>
   <sp who="#L0418_M1">
    <speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, these are the gardens, are they, very well—that will do. <stage> Exit Waiter, R.
      H.</stage> They look very pretty, really. I am a slave to first impressions, and I can see
     that I shall like them. How odd! Here have I been staying two whole days, and did not know of
     their existence. But then, I'm a newly married man, and I have to attend to my newly married
     wife, and new duties—and that will easily account for my ignorance upon such matters.
      <stage>(bell rings, R.H.)</stage> How the bells ring in this house, to be sure! Ah, well!
     since my marriage I have discovered they are not the only belles that have confounded noisy
     clappers. I'm a slave to first impressions, and if I had heard my wife's clapper before
     marriage, instead of after, I think it is very likely she would never have been Lady Meadows.

    <p>This way—this way my lady, if you please—take care of the step—this is the door.</p>
    <stage>Enter Doiley, L. H. showing in Emily.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>Is this the public room?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, my lady—opening, as you see, upon gardens, which I trust you will excuse my saying, are
     delightful. But you will of course, prefer private apartments, my lady?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, certainly—but do not let me be detained long. I must have post horses as soon as
     possible.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>You may rely upon me, my lady—I will now give orders for a sitting room to be prepared for
     you, and then   arrange about the horses. In the meantime, madam, you will not be intruded upon
     here. <stage>                                        Exit L.H.</stage>

   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>
     <stage> (sits.)</stage> Heigho! I almost regret now that I consented so hastily to this
     marriage with Frank. To my uncle, Sir Marmaduke Meadows, I look for everything beyond the mere
     <pb n="4"/> pittance I now possess. Frank is poor—nay, poorer than myself, and greatly do I
     fear that when my uncle finds I have wedded his nephew, his only sister's only child—whom he
     has so long and so pertinaciously discarded, that his wrath will overcome the love he has so
     long professed for me. So much for family feuds. Poor Frank! much and dearly as I love him, I
     cannot help fancying that it would have been better for us both, had we never met.
      <stage>(looks at watch.)</stage> Gracious heaven! <stage>(starts up.)</stage> Three o'clock,
     and I was to have joined Frank by two at the latest. Why, the packet sails at five—and I have
     yet another stage to go. <stage>(rings bell.)</stage> Yes, we must cross the water—land on the
     continent—and there remain until the anger of our mutual uncle shall abate. If he sees us in
     the first fit of his fury, we are disinherited, that's certain. Heavens! how impatient Frank
     will be at my non-arrival. <stage>(rings bell.)</stage>
     <stage>Enter Doiley with book, L.H.</stage> Now, sir, I am most impatient about the horses. I
     am going to Havre to night, and shall, I fear, be too late for the packet if detained. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>The horses will be ready, my lady, precisely in half an hour.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>   Half an hour?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>Am sorry to say you cannot possibly have them before.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>Well, sir, but then—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p> But then, my lady, you may depend on them. I beg pardon, madam, but I have brought a list of
     the ladies and gentlemen at present staying here. <stage>(giving her book.)</stage> Perhaps you
     will do me the honour of permitting me to enter your name? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p> Never mind that. <stage>(looks over book, carelessly.)</stage> It is very unlikely that any
     one I know is stopping here. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Nor, indeed, do I desire to see any
     person, until my uncle has decided what my fate, and that of Frank is to be. Ah! what do I see?
     Sir Marmaduke Meadows here? </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>Yes, my lady, Sir Marmaduke has been staying here for several days past.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <stage> (aside.)</stage>
    <p>Oh, heavens! how particularly unfortunate, to think that my uncle should be staying here. The
     very person, to avoid whom, I am now about to quit England. When I entered this house, I ran
     into the very lion's mouth. <stage>                                        (partly
      aside.)</stage>
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M5">
    <speaker>Doiley.</speaker>
    <p>Oh dear, no—I beg your ladyship's pardon—when you ran into this house, you ran not into the
     lion's mouth, but the “Bull's Head.”</p>

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>Psha! Shew me to my private room immediately— quick, sir.</p>

    <speaker>Bam.</speaker>
    <p> Emily? of course it is—we all know that very well— but it's all the same. Emily, one

   </sp>

    <p>Why Polly is just the same length as Emily.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M2">

    <p>Exactly so—right again! But Polly sounds shorter than Emily—and besides, my wife requested me
     to call her Polly—didn't you, Polly?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_F8">
    <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
    <p>

   </sp>

    <p>I'm sure of it. I recollect you said you had a particular aversion to the name of Emily.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M1">
    <speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
    <p>Then I must say, that I am very far from being pleased with the remark. Emily was her
     mother's name, and therefore ought to be respected.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M2">
    <speaker>Bam.</speaker>
    <p>

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M1">

   </sp>

    <speaker>Bam.</speaker>
    <p>Don't it? But people who see much of the world, always see strange things. Now for instance,
     the church at which we were married, is dedicated to St. Basil, and there   once upon a
     time—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M1">
    <speaker>Sir M.</speaker>
    <p>St. Basil? why your wife Emily—I mean Polly, told me, you were married at St. George's,

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M2">
    <speaker>Bam.</speaker>
    <p> And so we were. You may always credit what my

     out! But the truth is—let me see, what is the truth? The truth is, we were first of all married

    <p>I'll be bound he didn't! Yes, sir, we were married in France—and upon our return to this

    <p>More—more—nearly eighteen—full seventeen and a half! but he directed in his will that if his

   </sp>

    <p>Oh, very—very stylish affair—especially the first—I mean the one in France. Lots of the

   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M2">
    <speaker>Bam.</speaker>
    <p> Four! Well, she was right as she always is—Polly is never wrong. When I said a pair of
     horses, I meant a pair first, and another pair behind <hi>them</hi>. Perhaps it would have been
     more correct had I said <hi>two</hi> pair of horses? because here, a <hi>pair</hi> is
     understood to mean <hi>two</hi>; but in the part of the country where I have been residing, a
      <hi>pair</hi> always means four, two and two. <stage>(aside.)</stage> He seems surprised—talk
     about something else. But the great beauty of the horses of which I am speaking, was their
     colour—white—white as the driven snow. </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0418_M1">
    <speaker>Sir M.</speaker>

    <p> Black? did she say black? <stage>(aside.)</stage>
     <stage>(aside.)</stage>
     <hi>Then it wasn't a white lie.</hi> Then for once she was wrong. Yes, my wife Polly

    <p>Very! very strange! and yet no—now I come to think of it, it is not strange at all—I

    <p>It means my dear uncle, that, fearing to excite your   anger if the truth was told, I
     persuaded this gentleman to personate my husband for half an hour—but further deception is
     needless, and I now avow myself the faithful wife of Frank Tiverton.</p>

    <p> And I cannot refuse my promise to that. Half an hour of such matrimony as mine has been is
     quite sufficient to satisfy a moderate man like me for a lifetime. And now, released from my
     troubles as a new married man—restored to the good opinion of my friends and my sweetheart—all
     that remains to plead for is—that without which all else is useless and unprofitable —favour
     and forgiveness from kind friends, for myself, and— <stage>(pointing to Emily.)</stage> —my
     wife Polly! </p>
