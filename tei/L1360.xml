     over the apple pudding—for a domestic scene—is perfection itself; but the work suffers from
     want of interest. If you want to startle people now-a-days, your first volume should end with
     an abduction, your second with a murder, and your last with a suicide. Can't you work these in
     ? but don't give us lay figures—make your characters flesh and blood.—Yours, Toppleton Swidge."

     be brought in as an accessory before the fact. No, no, still it's " flesh and blood"—the very
