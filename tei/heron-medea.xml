      <stage>(c.)</stage> Oft have I wandered midst the savage tribes, whose only food the captives
      of the chase, or fruits spontaneous given by Nature's hand. With them my scanty store of bread
      I've shared, no sooner tasted than they wished for more. Then grains of wheat I've given. "
      Plant these," I've said, "not deeply—in the teeming soil, and soon the bounteous rain, and
      life-bestowing sun will cause it yield thee back a thousand-fold more bread than ye have
      planted grain." "But when?" the untutored mind inquired. "To-morrow?" "No!" I have replied;
      "to-morrow dig and plough, let labour sweeten life." This have they done, and on that very
      spot I've smiled to see the waving corn bend wooing to the breeze, and from its pregnant ears
      shake laughingly the glistening dew-drops back to its mother earth. Their tents then take the
      form of huts, then temples; cities, religion, industry and art spring from a few ears of corn,
      at my lyre's charmed sound. Thou seest, Jason, what victories may lie e'en in a grain of
      corn.</p>

     <p> Jason, for me there is no terror in thine anger. She left thee not. Her great proud heart
      was filled with love of thee. For thee she plunged in crime, and dared, the
       <emph>immortal</emph> vengeance. By you she was a mother. In you alone herself and children
      lived, she had no hope, they had no refuge but in thee. Jason, alive she never left thee.

     <p> I have, and wonder what cunning devil gave her fierce barbaric beauty power to enthrall me.

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M2">
     <speaker>Jason.</speaker>
     <p> Because she is a homicide accurst, at whose vile name men shudder and grow pale. Absyrtes'
      shade stalks gloomy through the land, while mangled Pelias from his red shroud shrieks out
      "Revenge," and fierce the cry re-echoes!—where'er we roved the Furies, in their shadowless
      hands holding Jove's thunder-bolts, pursued. In each city where we refuge sought, pestilence
      tracked our presence, and awe-struck citizens would yell "Accurst! accurst!" and drive us
      forth. I shared the punishment her crimes had merited. Her presence was a curse to me. I could
      no longer brave the horror, the hatred of the world, and so I rid myself of it and her.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M3">
     <speaker>Orph.</speaker>
     <p> The punishment her crimes had merited! Jason, thou art her crimes—thou art her punishment!
      she sinned for thee,—shouldst thou reproach her? Pure and unsullied thou foundst her in her
      savage home, and won her fond, confiding heart with false unholy vows, prompted by vile
      ambition, not by love ; but she did love as only woman can. Her father she betrayed for thee;
      murdered her brother for thee ; left her home desolate, and why ?—Be- cause, in all this
      universe, she saw no home but thee. And from her brow of shame, made so by thee, thou
      <pb n="6"/>sayst thy heart recoils: and thou shouldst blush to say it. Her family, her
      country, and her king—aye, all the earth might teem with accusations, but thou—thou shouldst
      be silent.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M2">
     <speaker>Jason.</speaker>
     <p> Not she, but I, the victim of our illicit passions. Wily as the serpent she coiled round my

    <sp who="#L0783_M3">

     <p> Whom ? Creusa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M2">
     <speaker>Jason.</speaker>
     <p> Yes, the gentle Creusa. Orpheus, the same fire that makes us soldiers, makes us lovers ; my
      nature thirsts for conquests, my heart is in its emotions overwhelming as the torrent,
      remorseless as the thunder, unfathomable as the sea! For Creusa's love, with resistless rain
      I'd inundate all Greece with blood and tears!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M3">
     <speaker>Orph.</speaker>
     <p> Love! oh, holy love! what sins the prostitution of thy name must answer for! Love! thy love
      is as the vulture's for the festering carcass; as the lion's for the lamb ; as the swollen
      stream for the flowery banks which, in its tumultous course, defiles their beauty, and
      destroys their bloom. But the gods will hear me—through me they'll speak.</p>

    <sp who="#L0783_M2">
     <speaker>Jason.</speaker>
     <p> What will they say ?</p>

     <speaker>Orph.</speaker>
     <p> Bid me, from thy foul grasp, release the innocent Creusa. Bid me reveal unto her father's

    </sp>
    <sp who="#L0783_M2">
     <speaker>Jason.</speaker>
     <p> Nor rage of man; nor wrath of gods I fear. Ere thou canst tell thy paltry tale, with one
      bold act I'll answer thee. The fierce Antestor, the scourge of Corinth and the people's dread,
      I've tracked; to-day his legions shall fly before me—thus avenging Ephyre: while he himself
      I'll captive bring, to kneel and beg for life at Creon's feet. Who then shall dare to slander
      Jason's name? Thou wilt not dare to speak, or speaking will be shamed to silence. I go to meet
      Antestor. Of all the deities, Venus alone I seek and sue; this day I dedicate to her and to
      Creusa. <stage>Exit, L. </stage></p>

     <p> How shall I speak ? In the deep recesses of a savage home I grew to womanhood. My parents
      loved me, Heaven smiled, and I was happy. One day, a strange warrior landed on our shores, in
      search of glory, danger, fame. He entered our abode, my father welcomed him; I was
      entranced;—my heart was pulseless ;—motionless I stood, awe-struck. He spoke; and at his
      voice, a torrent of delight coursed through my veins. I could not raise my eyes; still, still
      I listened. A blush, lit up with smiles, spread o'er my face; he spoke again—to
       <emph>me</emph>—to <emph>me</emph> ! It seemed as if some god had maddened me with joy! I
      raised my eyes to his—I looked—I <emph>loved!</emph>

      fear, I crossed our palace halls and sought my mother's chamber—she was sleeping—kissed her
      cheek, and thought how often by her side my infancy had slumbered : then placing on her breast
      some tresses of my hair, invoked the gods to temper her affliction on the morrow ! Mother,

     <p> No : keep them; their hearts are yours ; why should I enslave their forms. Go teach them

     <p> Alone, alone, in this wide world alone. Parents, country, children—lost, all lost for him,
      for Jason! Where now's the voice that lured me from the gods ? Breathing low whispers in
      another's ear. Where now the vows for which I bartered all ? Broken, broken, and he triumphs,
      thanks to me. I gave him to another; and whilst from his threshold I am proscribed and driven,
      he, happy father, bridegroom, prince, proud of his offspring, and their new-found mother;
      laden with glory, honour, love ! Gods of darkness to my aid! Create within my heart a
      vengeance yet unknown! Shut out the sun, envelope me with night! let eye not see, or tongue
      disclose the terror of my purpose. Pale deities of Hell instruct my hand, unbar my heart,
      unchain its hate, dry up the fountains of remorse. Impregnate me with thirst of blood—of human
      blood! Saturn! whose worship doth delight in infant's slaughter! to thee I call—thy altar is
      deserted, a sacrifice is near! be thou accomplice of my hate, that sacrifice is thine ; invest
      this Jason with immortal love for her! augment his hopes ! innate his soul, make him drunk
      with bliss! let him be father, husband, prince, be all, till that dark hour when my keen
      vengeance smite his pence, and he be left childless as Medea, widowed as her heart, and live
      and die unloved, accurst as she !</p>
