      <stage>Scene—A Drawing Room fitted up for an evening party—to the left a card table—doors, C.
        and L.</stage>

      <stage>Thwaites, who has finished lighting candles in chandelier at back, C., steps back to
        survey the effect.</stage>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Now, that’s what I call the real thing—the clean grit. The position of that bokey
            <foreign>(bouquet)</foreign> is such, that none but the purest taste could
          conceive,—those camellias, chastity itself. A fine combination! Cutting the turnips and
          carrots to make ornaments for the cold tongue; chusing the bokies at Covent Garden Market;
          mildly tempering the brilliant light of wax and gas with the soothing hue of flowers. I
          have brought all my arts to bear upon this sworry. The party who is a greengrocer in the
          morning, is the only perfect waiter in the evening.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage type="entrance">Enter Agatha, C.</stage>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(L.)</stage> So, Thwaites, the room appears quite ready?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(R.)</stage> Yes, Miss Agatha; without exaggeration I may venture to say, we are lit
          up.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> My father has not returned?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> No, Miss Agatha, he has not—since he left the house at two in the afternoon—I haven’t
          the slightest notion where he is gone.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Indeed! <stage>(laughing—sits, L. C.)</stage></p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> No—though I did my best to ascertain;—“Are you going far, sir?” says I. He stares, and
          he makes me no answer. “Shall you be long, sir?” says I. He stares again, and again he
          makes no answer. “Because sir,” says I, “there’s the party this evening!” “I know that,
            <pb n="4"/>better than you do,” says he, “for I shall have to pay for it!”—just like
          him, Miss Agatha—ha, ha, ha!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(aside—vexed)</stage> Really, ’pa must have a regular footman; these tradespeople
          whom he engages as occasional waiters don’t understand subordination a bit.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> I hope you admire the bokies, Miss Agatha; them camellias are quite the thing, I flatter
          myself;—all my taste—ha! ha! You’ll be called to-morrow the Lady of the Camellias!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Most offensive! <stage>(rises, and turns aside)</stage></p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Now, I thought I had said something very pretty—but she don’t look pleased.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> No one has arrived, of course?</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> On the contrary, Miss Agatha—I’m sorry to differ from you, but I rather think one has
          arrived, and is coffee-ing in the back parlor;—here he is, too!</p>

        <stage type="entrance">Enter Whitewash, C. from L. C., and down, C.</stage>

        <p>Mr. Whitewash, as I’m alive!—No occasion to announce you, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p><stage>(C.)</stage> Ah, my dear Miss De Windsor, excuse me if I stopped a minute to
          refresh myself with a <hi>demitasse</hi> of your choice Mocha instead of flying up stairs; but you
          see, a cause in which I was retained came on late, and I was obliged to exert myself a
          good deal—abnormally—if I may use the expression;—in short I was regularly knocked up.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Don’t think of apologies—as it is you are the first in the room. So you have had another
          brief to-day—I hope you have been victorious.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> One of my most brilliant triumphs! I actually outshone myself! <stage>(Thwaites
            listens)</stage> A rascal had stolen a watch from a gentleman’s pocket, and hid it!—ha,
          ha, ha!—in his umbrella.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Watch in an umbrella—come, that’s not bad!—ho, ho, ho!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Eh? <stage>(looks half offended—then continues without noticing Thwaites)</stage> There
          is not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel was guilty; indeed he had such a face that
          innocence would have been a positive fraud upon nature<pb n="5"/>—but, ha, ha, ha! I got
          him off—I got him off!—a weeping jury declared that he was not guilty.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Capital!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Which it is capital!—just like you, sir.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(draws Agatha aside)</stage> I say—this person—rather familiar.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> Yes, I know—I’m quite annoyed. He’s our greengrocer. ’Pa jokes with him in the morning
          when he buys the vegetables, and now he’s come to wait in the evening, he don’t understand
          his position at all.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> I think I’ll take the liberty of dropping a hint. I say, Mr.——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> Thwaites, at your service, sir. Cards ain’t common in our business; but my address
          is——</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p> Of your address, Mr. Thwaites, I have not the slightest doubt. But I would speak a word
          with you.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M4">
        <speaker>Thwaites.</speaker>
        <p> And I’ll listen if you talk for an hour. If I take up the newspaper, is it to read about
          politics? No! About plays?—No, I should rather think not! About pictures? bother, no! I
          look to see if Mr. Whitewash has been saying something for some poor devil in the Central
          Criminal Court. That’s my intellectual treat!</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(flattered)</stage> Indeed! ha! ha! Really, my dear Miss de Windsor we should do
          wrong to check this diffusion of intelligence among the masses.</p>
      </sp>

      <stage type="entrance">Enter De Windsor, C. from L. C.</stage>

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> He is here—is he—the dear boy. I must shake him by the hand. <stage>(rushes forward,
            r. c. and grasps Thwaites by the hand)</stage> Eh! ha! ha! You’re not Whitewash!
          Ridiculous! I’m always making myself ridiculous; I’ve too much heart. You feel what I
          mean, Whitewash. <stage>(shakes his hand violently)</stage> You feel what I mean.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(L. C.)</stage> Most acutely! <stage>(wringing his hand)</stage></p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> I’m so glad you are here before the others. Leave the room, Thwaites. <stage>(Thwaites
            lingers, moving at back to C.)</stage> I can now disburden my heart. As I said, I’m all
          heart. <stage>(Thwaites advances, c.)</stage> Leave the room, Thwaites! <stage>(Thwaites
            goes up, and moves chair from R. to C.)</stage> This moment is the most
          important—Zounds! Thwaites, will you leave the room?</p>

        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(coming to C.)</stage> Now look, I hesitate no longer; I shilly-shally no longer; I
          follow the dictates of my heart, and my heart tells me to—Come here, Whitewash—come here,
          Aggy. <stage>(joins their hands)</stage> Whitewash, consider yourself as my son-in-law.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course it is; I’m always sudden, I’m a creature of impulse. But do you dislike the

      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_F6">
        <speaker>Agatha.</speaker>
        <p> I did not say that, ’pa.</p>

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Didn’t say that, ’pa! Then why don’t you speak out? Wear your mind in your face, as I
          do, or as my young friend here, with whom I want to speak a few words in private. So, go
          and see how they are getting on with the coffee.</p>
      </sp>

      <sp who="#L0605_M2">
        <speaker>White.</speaker>
        <p>
          <stage>(R.)</stage> And don’t forget, that you are engaged to me for the first set, and the

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course, she won’t forget. Run along child.</p>

        <stage>Exit, Agatha, C., off, L.</stage>

        <p>Now, I can give vent to my feelings; Whitewash, you’ve done it. I was long making up my
          mind, but now, you’ve done it. You are one of the men I like. <stage>(shakes his hand

      <sp who="#L0605_M1">
        <speaker>De W.</speaker>
        <p> Of course you are. Look you, it’s only now that I like you; this very morning I weighed
          your merits with those of Tom Tango of the Stock Exchange, who you know has a sneaking
          kindness for my girl, and the balance was considerably in Tom’s favour. He’s a better
          looking fellow than you, and his conversation is more agreeable. Then, what’s a lawyer?
          said I, a creature all brains and no heart? no heart, sir! But now, I’m changed, my views
          are more enlarged—more expansive—I have been——</p>

        <p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the punctuation and spelling of the
          source text. A few changes were made for the sake of consistency and to correct minor
          errors.</p>

        <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

        <list>
          <item>p. 2: Changed the name “Fergusson” in both the character list and the costume notes
            to “Ferguson” to be consistent with how the name is spelled elsewhere in the
            text.</item>

          <item>p. 5: White. (l. c.) Most acutely! wringing his hand)—Inserted an opening
            parenthesis before “<emph>wringing</emph>”.</item>

          <item>p. 11: (some of the Company <emph>pass across at back of</emph> c. <emph>doors,
              from</emph>, l. <emph>to</emph> r.)—Deleted the comma after
            “<emph>from</emph>”.</item>

          <item>p. 14: De W. (aside) Why, Mr. Pawkins, what’s the cause of this singular
            hurry?—Pawkins’ and Whitewash’s subsequent lines indicate that both hear De Windsor.
            Therefore, the direction indicating that this line is an aside was deleted.</item>

          <item>p. 17: Gov’nor can’t be coming the old soldier!—Changed “Gov’nor” to “Gov’ner” for
            consistency.</item>

          <item>p. 18: Tango will have my daughter. ha, ha, ha!—Changed the period after “daughter”
            to an em dash.</item>

          <item>p. 18: Mr. De Winter, allow me to remark—Changed “De Winter” to “De Windsor” for
            consistency.</item>

          <item>p. 19: They say we were found in a cupboard at three o’ clock in the

        <p>Note that Thwaites re-enters on p. 21 when he delivers a letter to Whitewash, but there
          is no stage direction for Thwaites to exit after Pawkins tells him to “drop Miss Jemima”
          on p. 20. He could exit either at the end of Pawkins’ speech or when De Windsor apologizes
          to Pawkins.</p>
