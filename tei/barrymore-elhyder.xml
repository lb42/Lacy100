<div type="scene">
<stage type="setting"> Scene I —A fertile Valley near the City of Delhi,
occupied as an extensive military post, the horse-platforms forming, in regular
gradation, a passage over an immense mountain, over which fortifications appear
thrown. Music. At the rising of the curtain, a body of Mahratta Troops appear in
recumbent postures, their horses tied to trees and tents, while numerous pieces
of cannon arranged at the different entrances, mark the scene to be the seat of
war; the sun is seen to rise gradually over the distant mountains. </stage>

<l>Awake ! arise ! for opening day</l>
<l>Already brightens yonder hills,</l>
<l>While gloomy thoughts dissolve away, </l>
<l>And rapture every bosom fills!</l>
<l>Then, comrades, rise, with speed let's hie, </l>
<l>Revenge to seek, or nobly die !</l>
<l>Revenge! revenge! revenge !</l>

reaches the stage, a general shout)</stage>

<speaker>Koz.</speaker>
<p><stage>(r.)</stage>Welcome, noble chief! Thy presence gives fresh courage to
our almost drooping spirits. Say, when shall we forth again and meet our bold
oppressors? Lead us to the embattled plain, and there, by conquest, revive our
faded laurels.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">
<speaker>Mol.</speaker>
<p><stage>(l.)</stage>Aye, to the fight, great chief! defeat sits heavy at our
hearts. To the fight! and with blood-stained swords, warm from our enemies
breasts, wipe away our late disgrace!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p><stage>(c.)</stage> Disgrace! What tongue gives utterance to so foul a word?
Disgrace!—were not their numbers treble ours? Did we not dispute each inch of
ground ? Nor, e'er gave way till their overwhelming myriads swept us from the
field: and then, no trophy did we leave—no! naught but tattered
standards—gasping, mangled heroes, who, with their last breath did cry, " Allah
protect the right -our cause is just— we die content!" Disgrace, indeed!

</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">
<speaker>Mol.</speaker>
<p><stage>(c.) </stage>Your pardon, chief! I blush to think I gave loose to such
expressions. But, defeat is a theme Moloc is not used to. Let Hyder but grant me
pardon, and dearly shall that foe suffer who grave me cause for thus
offending.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>Enough ! Moloc, your hand. Men with souls like thine are truly worthy Hyder's
friendship.</p>

<speaker>Koz.</speaker>
<p>Now, then, chieftain, to business—the fight of yesterday—. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>Was, to the tyrant Hamet, a dear-bought victory.</p>

<p>His losses double ours.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>True ! but they weigh but as a feather in the scale when compared to
ours.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">
<speaker>Mol.</speaker>
<p>Hyder ! well you know our lives are devoted to the cause we raise our swords
for. A hero's death draws forth a soldier's tears: but never must they fall to
damp the soldier's spirit.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M11">
<speaker>Koz.</speaker>
<p>No! rather let them urge us to revenge. But say, good Hyder, how do our young
Prince and his royal mother bear the shock?—No answer! that averted head—speak,
chieftain, and ease our fears—has any ill befallen our royal infant ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>He lives and is well.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">

<p>Why those mysterious answers? Still silent! Does Hyder's band lack Hyder's
confidence ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>No, no! Hyder's heart is too well known. The—the— the Princess and her son
are prisoners.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_mult">
<speaker>Omnes.</speaker>
<p>Prisoners!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>Aye, prisoners to Hamet!—prisoners to that tyrant, who, by shedding the blood
of sweet innocence, seeks to gain a throne, which, when he sits there, will
become a throne of infamy—the seat of base pollution.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">
<speaker>Mol.</speaker>
<p>Our Princess a prisoner !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M11">
<speaker>Koz.</speaker>
<p>El Hyder their guardian, too !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>Yes, Moloc, even so. But why these downcast eyes? Am I to read mistrust ? El
Hyder doubted ! Did he not perform his duty?—Did he not protect his charge as
long as man was man? Behold! are these not witnesses ? Will not these wounds,
still reeking with my blood convey conviction to your minds ? Mark! here stood
the tent that held my sacred charge,—far beyond our flank, stretched the enemy's
horse—our wing was broken, overwhelmed, discomfitted—the Princess viewed it, and
cried for Hyder —Hyder flew to them—we were surrounded—-foe on foe ! I still
maintained my ground, but they seized the Princess and her son- I heard their
cries—saw them borne away—when I, with a Boa's rage, rushed to the rescue—a
conquering arm struck me down- and Hyder saw no more !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M10">
<speaker>Mol.</speaker>
<p>Oh, Hyder, do not think we doubt you! Quick, comrades, from his mind dispel
such thoughts—our country's love, our country's hope is——</p>

<p>Hyder!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>Oh grateful sounds! Comrades, your pardon—forgive but my hasty speech, and
Hyder again is happy.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M11">
<speaker>Koz.</speaker>
<p>And so would all around be, but that we fear Hamet's dreadful nature will
lead him to a commission of crime—our Princess's life is endangered, unless a
speedy rescue can secure her.</p>

placed within my power the Princess Zada and her son—though my <hi>interest</hi>
requires their <hi>death</hi>, (but Hyder's submission most), their lives are
saved on Hyder's yielding himself a prisoner—but instant death attend on Hyder's
refusal. Signed, <hi>Hamet.</hi>" Hyder then consented.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0082_M9">
<speaker>El H.</speaker>
<p>And saved their lives—one hour alone is mine—I must then to the city, and,
for the first time, yield myself a captive. Comrades, the brand of fierce
destructive war must be extinguished! Each then to his home—partake of peaceful
happiness, and when again my flag you see, I'll lead to death or victory.</p>

<p>There, madam, there lies your road. What, you would rebel—you would be

your here to-day and gone to-morrow men. No, no, madam, when you marry, the

<p>True ! but if the Rajah knew of your wicked tricks in the harem, he would not

<p>Why, if you persist in locking me up in this sequestered <pb n="6"/> spot,

beware, for if I once vow vengeance-—</p>

<p>You may put your threat in execution as soon as you can: but that I shall

off)</stage> A female and a child! and flying too, from the pursuit of an ugly
looking villain as ever eyes beheld. Let me conceal myself awhile, and if I can,
be of service to her. Hafez shall prove, that, though no great hero, he can act
the man when helpless woman claims his aid. But, where can I hide ? Ecod! here's
a place. A very snug one too. But first, let me take this, as I'm inclined to
think it may prove useful.</p>

<stage> Music — Hafez snatches up a bludgeon and enters the opening. Zada and
Chereddin now enter. Ben Tarab rushes in, seizes the Princess , struggles with
her, turns her round and gets possession of the Prince , draws a pistol, and is
about to shoot the Prince ,when Z Ada seizes him by the wrist, draws dagger from
his girdle, and plunges it into his shoulder — the pain forces him to relinquish
the Prince, and let fall the pistol, r.c. Zada exclaims " Fly, fly, Chereddin!"
He does so, and begins to ascend the rock. By this time Tarab has drawn the
dagger from his wound, and draws his sword. Zada retreats, he pursues, she
screams — Hafez rushes out, and with his bludgeon knocks Tarab's sword out of
his hand, as Zada faints into Hafez's left arm. By this time Chereddin has
gained the bridge. Tarab makes an attempt to get his sword, but Hafez, with his
bludgeon, stands on guard and makes a blow at him — he catches it, struggles
with him, and throws him to the ground, and then taking advantage of this,
ascends the rock, reaches the bridge, and seizes the child. Zada screams and
falls upon her knees. Tarab stands exulting, and is about to dash the child into
the torrent, when Zada sees the pistol Ben Tarab has dropped, and fires — he
staggers and relinquishes his hold of the child — then falls into the water. <pb n="19"/></stage>
<stage> Chereddin descends from the Bridge. Ben Tarab is seen striving to climb
the rock, but falls in the attempt, and is hurried over the cataracts. Chereddin
and Zada kneel and embrace. Hafez looks on exultingly. </stage>

<p>Listen! come closer, will you ? El Hyder and the Princess are both close at
hand. They met me in the forest this morning, and offered me two thousand gold
rupees if I would contrive to get them past this barrier. This I consented to,
told them I was your brother, could get the keys when I liked, and immediately
claimed the rupees.</p>

<p>Safe in El Hyder's purse. Think you such a man as Hyder was to be tricked ?
No, no—this was the bargain : the instant the barrier was opened, I was to
receive the money. And then what did I intend to do, but this: having got the
reward, I should have alarmed the guard, taken him prisoner, and claimed the
other five thousand offered by the Rajah for his apprehension. But as you have
in part discovered my plot, help me to complete it, and you shall have half with
me.</p>

<p>Aye, to be sure—we British lads espouse the cause of all who are oppress'd :
each true born Briton echoes forth the cry of freedom, and while a sword, a man,
or guinea lasts, surrounding nations shall all allow, that England is the first
to combat in the cause of liberty.</p>
