   <stage>Scene. — Room hung with Birdcages, birds in them ; bow window thrown out fitted up as an
    aviary, C., at back, the brasswork of the cage unfinished — the doors open and curtains hung
    over them on either side, to be easily dropped by a string — a screen partially covered with
    pictures at L. U. E., one side uncovered with canvas; door of entrance R. C.; cupboard with key
    in lock, L. U. E.; door, L. ; door, R. U. E.</stage>
   <stage>Mrs. Winkin discovered pasting photographs upon a half-finished screen, Mrs. Montgomery
    working, R., at table. </stage>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>My dear Mrs. Winkin, how many more pictures are you going to paste upon that screen ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, not half finished yet!</p>

    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>When are you going to fill up that space in the middle ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> That depends upon circumstances. Ever since we have been lodging in your house, and that's
     for the last four months, I have been entreating Mr. Winkin to have his portrait taken in a
     photograph, but he positively and sternly refuses; he says it's unlucky, and nothing on earth
     should induce him to have it done.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(rises)</stage> You surprise me, for I thought your husband in everything a perfect
     lamb of a man. Look at his love for birds, always surrounded by these beautiful specimens of
     the feathered tribe. <stage>(goes up, L. C.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> That's it, he doesn't care what money he spends on his Ava-davats and Java-sparrows. Look at
     the new aviary he's just been making.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(at back, C.)</stage> Yes, he really does show such good taste—but what are these
     curtains for?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> To be let down at night. They work by one string, and my husband's very proud of it as his
     own invention.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p><stage>(letting down curtains)</stage> Well, if it pleases him —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> Yes, he does it to gratify his own taste, not mine, for he won't accede to my most trifling
     request; so naughty too, when it's the fashion for every one to have a <hi>carte de visite,
     </hi> and I do like to be among the first in the fashion.</p>
   </sp>

   <sp who="#L0845_F5">

    <p>Oh, he's sure to give in!</p>

   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> Ah, you think so. Oh, you don't know Mr. Winkin ! There! I think I've done a good day's
     work. Dear me! quite a July morning, and I have nothing to walk out in but a black velvet
     cloak—I shall be suffocated.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>There's no necessity for that, I shall be delighted to lend you my China crape shawl—I am not
     going out myself.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Oh, thank you! <stage>(going up, R.)</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F5">
    <speaker>Mrs. M.</speaker>
    <p>Don't mention it, I am always delighted to oblige friends—don't distress yourself about the
     portrait, when I see Mr. Winkin, I'll try what <hi>my</hi> influence can do.</p>
    <stage> Exit, door R. C. in flat. </stage>
    <stage>(Mrs. Winkin as she rises puts her little hat and jacket on back of chair behind screen,
     where she has been sitting)</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> Her influence indeed! I like that — a pretty remark for one's landlady. If I did'nt know
     that Trotty actually worships the ground on which I walk I should be jealous—but she's a widow,
     and that's quite enough for me. I'm much obliged to her for the advice about the photograph,
     but I've got a little plan of my own. There's a new foreign artist settled at the corner of the
     square, and he tells me he can take my husband's likeness without his being aware of it. Now I
     must slip down this morning to his studio, and arrange how the affair is to be done.</p>

    <stage>(cries heard without —" Hollo ! there he goes !—have you got him ?—put a bit of salt on
     his tail! ")</stage>
    <p>Good gracious me! what is all that noise about {? <stage>(going to window)</stage> What a
     crowd ! Why it's my Trotty running round the square with one slipper on and no hat. I do
     believe it's that horrid paroquet loose again. <stage>(shouts without, " Yah!")</stage></p>

    <p> My Trotty, what's the matter?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_M1">
    <speaker>Wink.</speaker>
    <p> Matter! I've been up a tree—over the chimney pots—down a ladder—scaled a wall tastefully
     ornamented with glass bottles. By the way, I don't know whether you ever went over a wall
     tastefully orna —</p>

    <p> Elizabeth!</p>
   </sp>

    <p> Yes, much as it will go to my heart to deprive her of the sum of nine pounds sixteen
     shillings and eight pence
     <pb n="5"/>per annum, tea and sugar included, I must insist upon Mrs. Montgomery giving her
     warning.</p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#L0845_F4">
    <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
    <p> Oh, she's very honest, and if she's a little stupid — </p>

   <sp who="#L0845_M1">
    <speaker>Wink.</speaker>
    <p> Little stupid! she's a big stupid—a perfect idiot! This is the third time this week she's
     let that paroquet out of the cage—my beautiful female paroquet. She flew out of the window just
     as her cage was being cleaned by Elizabeth. I jumped forward and tried to seize her by the
     tail.</p>

    <p> No, no, the paroquet. I've got her back again now; however, after this, I'm determined to

    <p> Confound the photography, my wife's a perfect lunatic on the subject. I hate being done in
     any way, and especially in one of those cadaverous-looking pictures. We're always having a row
     about it. By the way, I'm rather glad she's gone off in a huff this morning, as I shall now be
     able to solve the mystery of that mysterious individual who, for the last three days, has
     haunted the exterior of this house. <stage>(goes to window)</stage> Ah ! there he is again,
     this time in a pork-pie hat. What can the eccentric individual want ? <stage>(throws up
      window)</stage> } He can't be the groundsel and chickweed for the birds, he hasn't got a
     basket. <stage>(shaking his head)</stage> Go away, whatever you've got to sell, we don't want
     any ! He did'nt hear me, he's lighting a cigar—now he's looking up at the top window of the
     house—now he's putting his hands to his heart; perhaps he's got a pain in the chest. Hollo !
     he's looking up again and kissing the tips of his fingers. He can't be saluting the
     chimney-pots. I won't see any more. <stage>(pulls down blind)</stage> A horrible suspicion
     seizes me. Lotty! my Lotty!—
     <pb n="6"/>her sudden change of temper—her going out alone—can it be that <hi>she</hi> is the
     object of those exaggerated demonstrations ? It may be. Oh ! what a fool I've been, it's all
     that paroquet! Ah ! while I have been looking after the comfort of my birds I've forgotten the
     peaceful security of my own nest.</p>

    <p>I really must get Mrs. Montgomery to light that staircase. I wonder who that was ; I couldn't
     see him, probably some one come to look after the lodgings upstairs. Remarkably uncivil, he
     began by nearly kicking me from the top of the stairs to the bottom, and when I remonstrated,
     he replied by referring me to the lower regions—not the ground floor, considerably lower. What
     a fool I was to suspect my Lotty. I hinted, gently hinted on the road that there was a change
     in her manner towards her Trotty; she answered with a gentle smile, "Trotty, pooh!" it was
     unanswerable; what could I say to pooh, pooh? and all the answer I can make is <stage>(seeing

     Mrs. Winkin ! Trotty, Trotty ! this is your "pooh !" It strikes me it's very far removed from
     pooh ! 'Gad, I'll open it! Gracious powers, what's this?—"Dearest;" no mistake about it, it's
     distinctly addressed to Mrs. Winkin. She's the " dearest!" " Dearest, but how can I call you
     dearest now ?" Ah, that's the question! "But I will!" That the answer. "But, though another has
     obtained your hand!" I suppose I'm another. "Yet I am sure I alone retain your heart!" Horrible
     assurance! " I've heard of the loathsome being. No, no, no, this won't do; we'll meet again,
     and then—Bob !" Why should they bob when they meet again? " P. S !" Oh, he hasn't done yet! Go
     it Bob—keep it up, Robert! "Whatever you may be, there is still a Bob unchanged !" A bob
     unchanged ! well, if that's all he's got to offer, it's about the meanest affair I ever heard
     of. Oh, Lotty, Lotty ! But I'll take change out of the bob, he shan't remain unchanged very
     much longer. I'll rush out and manfully meet the disturber of my peace, face to face, and when
     he's not looking I'll give him such a stinger in the back—and then if he returns the blow,
