<head>SCENE FIRST —Southampton Bar.</head>
<stage>Archway C., backed by streets in perspective. Act opens upon a corner of
a street in Southampton; R. and L. of 2nd grooves, two houses built out—one L.,
a military rendezvous and recruiting house, called, “The Iron Duke, kept by J.
Dobbs,” the sign representing the Wellington effigy. The walls of the “public”
bear the usual recruiting post bills—”Fine Young Men wanted,” “Who'll serve the
Queen?” &amp;c., the other house, R., forming corner of a street, is a
well-to-do looking middle-class residence. On the door is a large plate, upon
which appears the name of “Trumble, Solicitor.” As curtain rises—to the tune of
the “British Grenadiers”—Wattles, a recruiting sergeant, is discovered fixing
huge bunch of ribbons on a countryman's hat. Triggs, Polly Dobbs and others,
male and female, looking on a girl pouring out liquor. Some soldiers are
lounging about door, and a semi-drunken band, consisting of a drummer and a
fifer are playing at intervals— while, through the large open French window of
Trumble's house, first floor, R., (this window must be so constructed that the
action going on within the room is visible to the entire audience) Trumble
writing at an old-fashioned bureau covered with papers.</stage>

<p>Not serious! <stage>(to bystanders)</stage> Ladies and gentlemen, let me call

during the last twenty-four hours. Good-bye, I shall come back
again.<stage>                                        (Polly exits into house,

will—thin, perhaps, and wife to a Nabob, and mother to half-a-dozen india-rubber
looking children. <stage>(looking after her)</stage> Oh, woman, woman! once it
was love, and now it's furniture. But I'm a neglecting business, though love is
so much a matter of business now-a-days that it's difficult to know one from the
other. <stage>(looking up at window of house, L.)</stage> There's Trumble, hard
at work at the quarterly accounts, twisting noughts into sixes and nines—topping
and tailing, he calls it. I was to be back in twenty minutes with Mr. St. Clair,
but, bless me—what can time matter to old Trumble, except to charge for it?
<stage>(Soldiers singing within tavern as Triggs exits, R. U. E. Trumble rises
from chair, comes to window.)</stage></p>

fellows—they're to be shipped   off in a few hours, and it's a consolation to
think that we mayn't see any more of them. <stage>(Recruits and Soldiers sit at
table. Goes back to bureau and re-seats himself, as Robert Arnold, in the
costume of a journeyman locksmith, enters at back, R., as turning the corner of
tavern. He carries a basket of tools at his back, and is whistling
merrily.)</stage><stage>Re-enter Polly, from house, L.</stage></p>

cherries in a hungry fellow's way you must expect he'll have a snap at them.
Don't pout, Polly, or I'll repeat the offence out of desperation. <pb n="8"/>
Let's have more beer—oceans more! I stand glasses round. <stage>(all shout and
come forward)</stage> And Polly—<stage>(stopping her as she is going)</stage>

<p>That fellow, Triggs, has loitered on the road as usual. I'd better meet Mr.
St. Clair half way, for this noise is unendurable. <stage>(shuts window, as he
does so Silas Jarrett appears at back, from L. Loud laugh in tavern as he
enters. He pauses at sight of group before the tavern, and surveys the scene. He
is a ragged young fellow with a sort of hybrid appearance, between a mendicant
tramp and a dock labourer. A taste for gaudy colours is shown in the greasy red
and yellow handkerchief twined about his neck, and the equally greasy ribbon
that dangles from his torn straw hat. His hair, which is uncombed, hangs in
tangled masses over his forehead, a sort of thatch, beneath which his eyes peer
out in a sinister and savage manner.)</stage></p>

<p>Curse them! what a row they're making! If I knew how to stop their merriment
I would! I can't bear to see people enjoying themselves; it's an insult to my

tavern door, he comes slowly forward, limping slightly, as footsore)</stage>
Enjoy themselves! the fools! it's brief pleasure without money! There's Robert
Arnold, honest, hardworking Robert—who's always mocking me, or patronising me
with the insolence of his pity. <stage>(savagely)</stage> Honest Robert! good
Robert! hardworking Robert! Ah! if hate could kill you'd have been dead long
ago. <stage>(leans against wall of Trumble's house in the shadow, as Trumble
comes out, closes door behind him, and passing Silas without notice, exits R.
C.)</stage> There goes another sort of fool, a rich one, who plods! plods!
plods! plods! like the working bee, not caring to enjoy the honey he creates.
They're looking this way, and are talking about me no doubt. <stage>(changing
manner suddenly to that of a man labouring under semi-intoxication)</stage>  
There's no mask like drunkenness, behind it one can learn the thoughts of
others, and conceal one's own.</p>

so as to show in perspective the elevation of the poop with mast, sail, rigging,
lifeboat, &amp;c., &amp;c. Man at the wheel, Officer of the Watch near him; the
latter nodding asleep. On the level of the stage, the whole interior of cabin is
visible, berths on each side, ladder ascending to poop-deck, stern portholes
showing the rippling sea, which is also visible beyond the poop-decks in a
shimmer of moonlight. Cabin table, chairs, &amp;c., as in passenger boat of the
second class. At table, beneath the usual <pb n="22"/> swing lamp, Silas Jarrett
seated, his head is uncovered, showing a bush of red hair, while the lower part
of his face is concealed by a thick beard of the same colour. He wears a loose
great coat. Two bottles are on table, and he is drinking from a glass which he
constantly refills.</stage>

<stage>SCENE.—The Quarries at Dartmoor. The convict prison in middle distance,
R. In extreme distance a vast extent of moor, wild and undulating, with large
boulder rocks or tors. Down stage, L., huge boulders of slate, partially worked,
a rough road is quarried among them, descending by a gentle incline to stage. To
R. near C., and somewhat further up stage the dark boulders rise into a sort of
hill, from the top of which another road is quarried, also descending amidst
rock and ferns to and off stage. On the summit of this heap of rocks, stunted
trees with other varieties of wild, coarse vegetation; framed, so to speak, by
this foreground; the quarries stretch out behind, full of caves and crevices,
towering up or descending suddenly into deep fissures, old or neglected workings
half-hidden by the hardy herbage which clings even to these rugged rocks. The
prison is on a height. A gloomy range of buildings, which, though distant,
dominates by its very presence, the savage scene. Convicts are grouped
everywhere about at work, quarrying or wheeling off slate in red trucks, under
the guard of Warders, in dark blue uniform with white metal buttons (frock coat,
leather belt, black varnished cap.) Some of these Warders carry muskets, others
wear swords. The “Good Conduct” Convicts wear loose a frock with knickerbockers
and coarse woollen stockings, all of a dirty blue with pink stripes. The “Bad
Characters,” B. C., are clad in drab and black parti-colour, and they work with
a belt fastened round the waist under the frock. All have the tunic cut frock,
with <pb n="25"/>buttons in front, knickerbockers of same pattern—the B. C. “Bad
Conduct” have one knickerbocker of black, the other drab, ditto stockings—the
caps, more like those of the Chasseurs d'Afrique than the Glengarry, are of the
same stuff as frock with same stripes—the boots strongly made highlows. The
Convicts carry various quarrying tools, picks, &amp;c. As curtain rises, Robert
Arnold, in “good conduct” dress is discovered at work, L.</stage>
<stage>Enter Jack Snipe, with Two Convicts, R., also in “good conduct” dress,
stops in his work, looks round to be sure that no warder is listening, then
comes down stage. Several Convicts, who have also stopped work, follow his

barrows from back and off, L.</stage>

entrance to house, L.— small pavilion, R. U. E. Shrubberies, masking garden
walks, L. C.—gates on country road—towards R. there is a garden fence—a small
wicket gate, this gate, like the larger gates, is open—at extreme back trees,
above which is seen ivy-clad tower of church—garden tables R. and L., with
chairs —bird on table, R.</stage>
<stage>Polly is busy with birdcage, R., hung against pavilion into which she is
putting water and seed—rustic benches, seats, tables, &amp;c., dispersed about
