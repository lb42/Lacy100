      <p><stage>(R.)</stage> A country boy! ha, ha, ha! How long has this scheme been in your

      <p><stage>(L.)</stage>Some time.— I am now convinced of what you have often <corr>been</corr>

     <sp who="#L0042R_M2">
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>Oh, are you satisfied at last, Mr. Lovel, I always told you, that there is not a worse set
       of servants in the parish of St. James's than in your kitchen.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M1">
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>'Tis with some difficulty I believe it now, Mr. Freeman; though, I must own, my expenses
       often make me stare.— Philip, I am sure— is an honest fellow; and I will swear for my blacks—
       If there is a rogue among my folks, it is that surly dog Tom.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M2">
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>You are mistaken in every one. Philip is an hypocritical rascal; Tom has a good deal of
       surly honesty about him; and for your blacks, they are as bad as your whites.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M1">
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>
        Pray tell me; is not your Robert acquainted with my people? Perhaps
       he may give a little light into the thing.</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M2">
      <speaker>Free.</speaker>
      <p>To tell you the truth, Mr. Lovel, your servants are so abandoned, that I have forbid him
       your house. However, if you have a mind to ask him any question, he shall be forthcoming.</p>

      <p>You shall: But it is an hundred to one if you get any thing out of him; for though he is a
       very honest fellow,
       <pb n="4"/>yet he is so much of a servant, that he'll never tell any thing to the

      <p>This letter. It is an anonymous one, and so ought not to be regarded; but it has something
       honest in it, and put me upon satisfying my curiosity—Read it.</p>

      <p>My plan is this—I gave it out that I was going to my

       and lay at Basingstoke—</p>

      <p>I ordered the fellow to make the best of his way down into the country, and told him that I

      <p>Sir, I have not the honour to be known to you, but I have the honour to serve His Grace the
       Duke of—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M1">
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>And the impudence familiarly to assume his title. Your grace will give me leave to tell
       you, that is the door.<stage>(Duke crossing, L., bowing)</stage>— and if you ever enter there
       again, I assure you, my lord duke, I will break every bone in your grace's
       skin.—Begone!—<stage>(Exit Duke, L.)</stage>I beg their ladyship's pardon; perhaps they cannot go without chairs—Ha,
       ha, ha!
     <stage>(Sir Harry steals off, across with table cloth hanging out of coat pocket. Lovel
      puts his foot on the end, which drags it out, several spoons fall with it on the
      stage).</stage></p>

      <p>But you Sir, for your villany, and (what I hate worse) your hypocrisy, shall not stay a
       minute longer in the house; and here comes an honest man to shew you the way out. Your keys,
       sir.</p>

     <stage>(Philip gives the keys)</stage>
     <stage>Enter Tom, L.</stage>
     <p>Tom, I respect and value you. You are an honest servant and shall never want encouragement.
      Be so good, Tom as to see that gentleman out of my house <stage>(points to
      Philip.)</stage>—and then take charge of the cellar and plate.</p>
     <sp who="#L0042R_M4">
      <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
      <p>I thank your honour; but I would not rise on the ruin of a fellow servant.</p>

      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>No remonstrance Tom, it shall be as I say.</p>

     <sp who="#L0042R_M1">
      <speaker>Lovel.</speaker>
      <p>And I intend to make your Robert so, too. Every honest servant should be made
       happy; and if persons of rank would truly act up to their station it would be
       impossible that their servants could ape them; — but when they descend to what is ridiculous,
       it will be in the power of any low creature to follow their example.</p>
