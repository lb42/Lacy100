<head>Scene I .—The Summit Of A Scandinavian Mountain.</head>
<stage> Pinnacles of rock glittering with frost, and various colours in the
stone. The Gods of Scandinavia are all ranged at the back, as subsequently
mentioned, but at the rise of the curtain, clouds entirely conceal them. Lights
down. Voices of Spirit Of The Age, and of the Author, heard —Spirit laughingly
calling to him to come on, and he grumbling. </stage>

<l>Hang me if I know.</l>
<l>The "Arabian Knights" were used up long ago;</l>
<l>The Genii, Planche's genius makes his own, </l>
<l>Ere we can say (his name) "James Robinson." </l>
<note type="ed">James (not Jack) Robinson Planche wrote many fairy burlesques
between 1845 and 1852 but nothing called The Genii </note>
<l>Smith's hammer has been beating, as I'm told, </l>
<l>Alhambra's ore into good fairy gold. <note type="ed">This is probably nothing
to do with the Alhambra Theatre in Leicester Square, which did not open till
1854. Smith might be Albert or Arthur, but nothing about hammers. </note></l>
<l>Most of the Operas are atrocious stuff, </l>
<l>And the Bohemian Girl's eloped with Brough.</l>
<note type="ed">The Bohemian Girl, an opera composed by Balfe with lyrics by
Alfred Bunn dates from 1843. The brothers Brough mounted a parody called
<title>Arline; or, The Fortunes and Vicissitudes of a Bohemian Girl </title>
premiered at the Haymarket on 21/4/51</note>
<l>There's nothing left but the old track to follow, </l>
<l>With Jupiter, and Juno, and Apollo.</l>
<l>They'll do again, and every one confessses </l>

<l>No, England wants no Idol-farce from Rome.</l>

<l>Much as Greek Gods were pleased to be diverted, </l>
