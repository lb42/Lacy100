<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> I declare, if it wasn't for meeting some of the girls as they come home from
flower-making, I should feel as lonely as a milestone. Three years have I been
in the force, and a woman of fortune hasn't fallen in love with me so far. I've
been looking out for a roll of bank-notes without an owner, for the last two
years, but I haven't seen 'em yet. I fancy there is more chance for a fellow in
the army. I wish I was a blue Scotch grey, instead of a blue bobby. A man of my
appearance ought to do something; men of my personal attractions are not picked
up every day ; but still I don't seem to go off, somehow. Ladies of fortune!
where is your taste ? Open your eyes, some of you, or I'll take a dreadful oath
to die single. Ah, it's the dinner hour at Madame Fanchon's, and here come some
of her hands. I wish one of them would set me on my legs—but, like me, their
faces are their fortunes. <stage> Enter Anne Brown, Mary Green, Carry White, and
others, R.</stage> Good day, ladies—flowers of Nature, who live by making
artificial ones. May husbands of a thousand a year marry every one of you, and
sprigs of little offshoots blossom in the garden of your happiness.</p>

<p> What, Blueskin ! Come, now, that's too bad ; it's enough to make one wild.
Now, here comes a much more civil and pretty girl. I always did like Miss Bobbin
—but whether that's her surname or her Christian one, I don't know—I'll ask
her.</p>
</sp>

<stage>Enter Bobbin, R.</stage>

<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> Now she <hi>is</hi> a sensible girl—if she only had

</sp>

<p> What, money ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Yes.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Well, I think some day there will be a little coming to me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Ah, Miss Bobbin, you don't know what a great favourite you always were of
mine.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="7"/>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> How should I, when you never told me ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> I didn't know it myself till just now. By-the- bye, is Bobbin your Christian
or surname ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> It's both.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> How can that be ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Why, because my reg'lar name is Robinette Robins; my father's name was Robin
Robins, and my mother had me called as near after him as possible, by naming me
Robinette ; then the girls, for shortness, called me Bobin—others called me Bob
; some began to call me Bob, and Bob Robbins, until at last it got to be
Bobbins, and Bobbins it seems likely to remain.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Now, isn't it singular that both our names begin with a B ? Mine's Batter,
and yours is Bobbin—Batter and Bobbin.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Yes, one letter for both names ; and my friend Lizzie Lyle's name is begun
both ways with one letter— L for Lizzie, and L for Lyle—L. L.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> You see it hung up in most publicans' windows —L. L., which means Lord
Lieutenant's whiskey ; so, perhaps she comes of the same family.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Perhaps she does, and she's a genteel girl. She don't write bad—neither do
I, and if we get hold of a hard word, we mix a lot of letters together to look
as like it as possible.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p>Has she got a sweetheart ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> There's one as wants to be—Madame Fanchon's clerk; Mounseer Froggyvoo we
call him, but Adolphe Durand, I believe, is his correct name.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> Does she like Froggyvoo ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F11">
<speaker>Bobbin.</speaker>
<p> Not at all; and when she goes out he's always following her. <stage>(looks
R.) </stage>He's following her now, although he knows she has only an hour for
dinner ; but here I am talking when I've got to get her dinner ready. I wish you
wouldn't keep me talking here—my time will be up. Goodbye—things ought to be
done, and time is flying, and dinner ought to be frying—this and that put to
rights, and I don't know what all. <stage>(exit, L.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M4">
<speaker>Batter.</speaker>
<p> But Robinette Bobbins—Bobbins—Rob—Bob— stop, a word with you—half a word,
stop! <stage>(exit, L.</stage></p>
</sp>


<stage> Enter Lizzie, R., followed by Adolphe.</stage>

<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> Now, Mr. Durand, what a strange thing it is ; although there are plenty of
girls working on our establishment, you will always insist on forcing your
society upon me whenever you see me alone. Why do you do it ?</p>
</sp>
<pb n="8"/>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p> Because, ma'amselle, I feel confidant that you adore me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p> I don't—quite the reverse. You are too conceited, and fancy every girl is in
love with you ; and, now, I'd better tell you what I've long had on my mind : I
don't like you at all—in fact, to put a stop to your annoyance, I may say I
detest you—there !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p>Why, you insult me ! Is it insolent in this country to say to a ma'amselle
you love her ? This is insult, and insult I take from no one. <hi>You</hi>
despise me, indeed! and for vhy ? You are no fine lady. I suppose you think some
gentleman will offer you his fortune—bah, you vill see!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_F12">
<speaker>Lizzie.</speaker>
<p><stage>(aside)</stage> I have spoken too plainly—he has influence with
madame, and may injure me in her good opinion.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M3">
<speaker>Adolphe.</speaker>
<p> Despise, indeed! A moment past I adore you —now I hate, and ven I hate it is

<p> Yes, guv'nor, we've not long taken to the honest trade of prigging, but was
told if there ever was a man who could finish the eddication of two novices in
the line, that gemman was the respected Mr. Mathew Barkin.</p>

<p> You has. Vere recommended by Jack Flanagan, of Seven Dials—he would have
written to you, only he says that he knows as you knows that he can't write.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L1300_M9">
<speaker>Mat.</speaker>
<p> No, he can't—his eddication was neglected in early life—he can only make his
mark, and has lived on the cross ever since; but he's a nice man.</p>
