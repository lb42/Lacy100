<head>Scene</head>
<stage> Back parlour at Mr. Plummy's.—The shop (a Chemist and Druggist's) seen
through the door C. Chairs, tables, &amp;c. Doors R. and L ; packages of
medicines, and medicine bottles piled about.</stage>
<stage>Mr. and Mrs. Plummy seated at breakfast. </stage>
<stage>Bell heard.</stage>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> There is the shop bell, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> I hear it. I never sat down to any meal in my life, breakfast, dinner, tea,
or supper, that that bell didn't instantly begin to ring.</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Joe from C., with a pill box in his hand.</stage>
<sp who="#L0327_M5">
<speaker>Joe.</speaker>
<p> Please, sir, here's Mrs. Jones, the laundress, says you sent her the wrong
pills yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(flinging down his knife and fork.)</stage> There ! Did you ever hear a
more ridiculous message than that ? What can it possibly signify to the woman
what sort of pills she takes! They're all the same price. Begone, sir, and
interrupt me again at your peril! <stage>(Joe runs out.)</stage> Now my dear,
another egg, eh ? Some more ham ? Humph!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> No more, thank you, Henry, I've done. <stage>(folds up her
napkin.)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Done breakfast! Why you've hardly begun!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P. </speaker>
<p>I can't waste two hours over so insignificant a meal as you do.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> What do you mean by wasting two hours? I'm eating the whole time. The fact
is, Mary Matilda, you <pb n="4"/> never do eat! You think you do, but you don't;
you only nibble—I'll be bound you didn't notice that these eggs were boiled as
hard as Derbyshire petrifactions!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> I confess I did not.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> I'll trouble you for the butter.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> You took the last bit just now.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> I suppose there's more in the house ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> No, the man forgot to call yesterday.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> No butter ! I don't mean to butter myself, I mean flatter myself, but really
do think that my little comforts deserve a little more attention.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Here's a piece more ham, dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Ham! You know I don't care much about ham. <stage>(sticking his fork into a
large slice of ham, and beginning to eat it. )</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(laying her hand on his arm just as he is raising a piece of ham to his
mouth.)</stage> Now, listen to me, Henry dear; if you indulge so much in the
pleasures of the table, and take so little exercise, you'll very soon become so
stout that you'll be quite an object !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Stout! Me! Ha! ha! ha! I like that! <stage>(trying again to eat.
)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(stops him.)</stage> And then, Henry dear, I shan't be able to endure the
sight of you; for if there is one thing I have a greater horror of than another,
its <hi>a little fat man !</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> My dearest Mary Matilda, you're wrong ! I happen to be getting thinner every
day !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> How can you say so ? Haven't I been obliged to let out every one of your
waistcoats ? But put on your hat, and we'll go out and take a walk.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> A walk! You forget the well-known proverb: " After breakfast walk a mile." I
mean " Sit a mile," I should say " Sit awhile."</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P. </speaker>
<p>But I particularly want you to go shopping with me.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> You really must excuse me ! Going shopping is a thing I detest! The girls
look at me so ! 'Pon my life they do ; but there's cousin George, he'll go with
you —he don't mind the girls looking at him—he rather likes it.</p>
</sp>
<pb n="5"/>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Henry, remember what I said just now! Without exercise you're sure to be
ill! You <hi>never</hi> leave the house except to<hi> dine out.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Mary Matilda, there are certain sacred duties we owe to society, and dining
out is one of 'em.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Nay, Henry, you must come with me. I have seen such a love of a riding
habit, and so cheap.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Of course, of course! But considering that you're not in the habit of
riding, I don't see how you can possibly want a riding habit.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Why for our trip to Switzerland, of course; you've promised to take me for
the last three years.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(aside.)</stage> There's the old story beginning again
!—<stage>(aloud.)</stage> Now Mary Matilda, let me ask you, as a sensible woman,
how can I possibly leave my business ? Besides, what's the use of going all the
way to Switzer­land when you can see Mont Blanc without stirring out of
Piccadilly, and have a comfortable chair to sit on into the bargain ! That's the
sort of travelling <hi>I like.</hi></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(nettled.)</stage> In short, sir, you <hi>refuse</hi> to take me? Very
well, Mr. P !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(taking a lump of sugar out of basin, and putting it into his
mouth.)</stage> Now how can you be so unjust ? Knowing your partiality for
Switzerland, did'nt I take you last week to the waxwork, and did'nt I show you
William Tell, with the identical bow and arrow with which he shot his little
boy's head off—-I mean something or other off his little boy's head ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Yes, yes! Come, Henry, when shall we start ? <stage>(taking his arm,
coaxingly.)</stage> This day week ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> This day week! I've business! Important business to attend to.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> What business ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Why I've got to collect my pills! I mean bills.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> That's very soon done. You've only got to ask for your money.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> I beg your pardon! I've got to <hi>get</hi> the money after I <hi>have</hi>
asked for it. Besides, I must consult our friend, Doctor Dulcet, about you.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> About me! I'm perfectly well!</p>
</sp>
<pb n="6"/>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Exactly! Then as the pure air of Pentonville agrees with you, why leave it ?
Common sense suggests the question, Why leave it ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Pshaw!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M3">
<speaker>Cousin George.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(without.)</stage> This way! This way! Gently with the crockery!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Crockery! What's the meaning of "Crockery?" <stage>(smash heard.)</stage>
Oh, that's what it means!</p>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Cousin George at door C., followed by Two Men, carrying a large
hamper, which they put down.</stage>
<sp who="#L0327_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(to Plummy, and holding out his hand.)</stage> A shilling!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(bewildered, mechanically puts his hand into his pocket, and gives George
money, who gives it to men.)</stage>
</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M8">
<speaker>Men.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(to George.)</stage> Thank your honour ! <stage>(The Men go out at C. and
R.</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p>
<stage>(to George.)</stage> Thank <hi>your</hi> honour! Considering the shilling
came out of <hi>my</hi> pocket, I think he might have thanked my honour ! But
what does all this mean ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p> Why, it means that as Mrs. Brittle, round the corner, couldn't pay your
little account for medicines, I took it out in crockery—such a bargain!
Thirty-nine dozen soup-plates, seventeen tureens, and a salad-bowl— think of
that!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Well, 'pon my life, Mrs. Brittle is a cool sort of a person. She paid my
last account with forty-seven dozen pie-plates, and a tea-pot. Never mind, I'll
be even with her; I'll go this moment and order the handsomest dessert service
she's got in her shop, and pay her out in pills.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Dont! Poor woman, she's a large family. <stage>(puts on her bonnet and
shawl.)</stage> By-the-bye, Cousin George, you havn't breakfasted ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p> Never mind! Are you going out, Cousin ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Yes, when Mr. Plummy's ready; he's only been two hours over his breakfast,
that's all!</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M3">
<speaker>George.</speaker>
<p> For shame, Plummy—by-the-bye, how stout <pb n="7"/>you're getting!
<stage>(to Mrs. Plummy.)</stage> I needn't say how delighted I should feel if
you would accept my arm.</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_M1">
<speaker>Plummy.</speaker>
<p> Of course she will, and thank you into the bargain. <stage>(aside.)</stage>
And so shall I. I wouldn't be with a cousin in the house for all the world;
cousins are such easy, good-natured, useful creatures—poor devils !</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">
<speaker>Mrs. P.</speaker>
<p> Perhaps you will condescend to oblige me by walking as far as Mr. Buffer's ?
<stage>(to Plummy.)</stage></p>

great Buffer ?</p>
</sp>
<sp who="#L0327_F6">

<p> Why ask him for the situation you promised to obtain for Cousin George.</p>

forgot I had a weighing machine, and there it is. Here, Joe, bring in the
weighing machine! <stage>(Joe pushes in weighing machine at door C. then goes

again ; if I have only lost an ounce, I shall be satisfied, perfectly satisfied!

the stouter I get! Ah! <stage>(seeing Doctor, who enters at door R. H., rushes,

more exercise ; the more I take, the stouter I get! I've done more in the last

<p> Yes, every inch of the way, except between Dover and Calais, and that I mean
to swim! Slide, my boy, you shall go with us, and what's more, I'll undertake to
make a thinner man of you, and restore Mrs. Slide to your arms. I'll tell you
how I'll do it—you shall carry me on your back to the top of Mont Blanc three
times a day for a fortnight. So let's be off, and when I get back, if ever I do
get back, I shall have this satisfaction, at least, that no one will be able to
say of me, "How stout you're getting."</p>
